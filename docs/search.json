An estimate of the heritability of a trait is specific to one population in one environment, and it can change over time as circumstances change. Heritability estimates range from zero to one. A heritability close to zero indicates that almost all of the variability in a trait among people is due to environmental factors, with very little influence from genetic differences.

    "text": "Is it appropriate to define intelligence?\nRegarding the philosophical nature of precisely defining intelligence, “we have, no doubt, a rough and ready idea of what we mean by ‘intelligence’ and other cognate terms. The objective of scientific enquiry is to advance beyond this primitive, common-sense understanding (what is often termed ‘folk psychology’) to a more securely grounded set of scientific theories, based on empirical evidence and capable of ordering the world in possibly new and illuminating ways. We shall not achieve this goal by insisting on a rigorous, precise definition of terms at the outset. New definitions are the end product of scientific enquiry, not its starting point” (Mackintosh 2011, 2)\nWe ask ourselves, “what is intelligence?” (eg. is it: processing speed; reaction time; working memory; verbal ability; spatial ability; rationality; practical intelligence; emotional intelligence etc;) Imagine a variable that predicts how someone does generally in all of these abilities. What should we call this variable?"

    "text": "The g factor\nThe variable described above is commonly referred to as the “general factor of intelligence” or g factor. The g factor is a statistical construct that represents an individual’s overall intelligence level, and it is considered to be a fundamental concept in the field of psychology.\nThe existence of the g factor has been supported by decades of research across a wide range of intelligence tests and measures. For example, individuals who perform well on one cognitive task, such as verbal ability, tend to perform well on other cognitive tasks, such as spatial ability, indicating a positive correlation between various cognitive abilities.\nMoreover, the g factor has been found to predict a range of important life outcomes, such as academic and job performance, income level, and even health outcomes. Therefore, the g factor is not only a theoretical construct, but it also has practical implications for our understanding of human abilities and potential.\nNobody has ever been able to come up with an assessment for any sort of cognitive ability which does not correlate with the rest of them. The intercorrelations are caused by a general underlying factor which consistently explains half of the variance in a battery of cognitive ability tests (Mackintosh 2011, 45); (Deary 2001, 222); (Deary 1998); (Lubinski 2004, 98)."

    "section": "The CHC model",
    "text": "The CHC model\nThe Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) theory of intelligence is a prominent model that attempts to explain the structure of cognitive abilities. The theory proposes that intelligence is composed of a hierarchical structure of three strata: the general factor (g factor), broad abilities, and narrow abilities.\n\n\n\nCattell–Horn–Carroll theory of intelligence\n\n\nAt the top of the hierarchy is the g factor, which represents a general factor of intelligence that is common to all cognitive tasks. The broad abilities, located in the middle stratum, are a group of abilities that are less general than the g factor but still encompass a range of related cognitive tasks. Examples of broad abilities include fluid reasoning, crystallized intelligence, processing speed, and working memory. Finally, the narrow abilities, located at the bottom stratum, are specific abilities that are highly specialized and task-specific.\nThe CHC theory supports the existence of the g factor by showing that performance on different cognitive tasks is highly correlated, indicating a common underlying factor that influences performance across tasks. In addition, factor analyses of a wide range of intelligence tests consistently reveal a strong first factor that represents the g factor.\nMoreover, the CHC theory provides a framework for understanding the relationships between the g factor and other cognitive abilities. For example, fluid reasoning is considered a broad ability that is strongly related to the g factor and is involved in abstract thinking and problem-solving. Crystallized intelligence, on the other hand, is a broad ability that represents the application of knowledge and skills acquired through experience and education and is less strongly related to the g factor.\nBecause it has an impressive body of empirical support in the research literature (e.g., developmental, neurocognitive, outcome‐criterion), this model of intelligence is the one that psychologists predominantly use. It is used extensively as the foundation for selecting, organizing, and interpreting tests of intelligence and cognitive abilities. (Alfonso et al. 2005);(Beal 2006);(McGrew et al. 2005);(Schneider et al. 2012) Additionally, this model is the most comprehensive and empirically supported psychometric theory of the structure of cognitive abilities to date. (Flanagan and Dixon 2014)\nCHC is the best model from exploratory factor analysis (J. B. Carroll, B, and Press 1993) and is confirmed by confirmatory factor analysis (Gustafsson 1984); (J. Carroll 2003) (Jewsbury, Bowden, and Duff 2017). Confirmatory factor analysis showed that purposely different IQ batteries (CAB, Hawaii Battery, WAIS, etc) were analyzed, and it turned out that the g factors computed from the respective tests were statistically indistinguishable from one another, despite the fact that the tests tapped into partly different sets of abilities.

    "section": "Neurobiological theories",
    "text": "Neurobiological theories\nThe leading neurobiological theory for intelligence is called the Parieto-Frontal Integration Theory (P-FIT). It has been described as “the best available answer to the question of where in the brain intelligence resides” (Deary and Penke 2010)\n\n\n\nA schematic showing the P-FIT model. The circles correspond to brain regions that are often functionally important for solving tasks related to g and abstract reasoning. Dark circles are areas that are usually in the left hemisphere of the brain, while light circles are usually in the right hemisphere. The numbers correspond to Brodmann areas, which is a standardized system of mapping regions of the brain. The double-headed arrow corresponds to the arcuate fasciculus, a white matter structure that connects many of these brain regions. Source: (Jung and Haier 2007, 138)\n\n\nAbove is a visual representation of P-FIT. In this model, there are several brain regions, mostly located in the frontal lobe (towards the front of the brain) and the parietal lobe (on the top part of the brain, somewhat towards the rear), that are connected with a white matter tract called the arcuate fasciculus. According to the P-FIT model’s creators, g arises from both how well these areas function and how well they are connected to one another in the brain (Jung and Haier 2007). This explains two initial hurdles to understanding how g relates to the brain. The first is why there is no one area in the brain that is activated when a person engages in reasoning tasks. The second hurdle is why several previous studies had suggested that the size and use of multiple areas in the parietal and frontal lobes were correlated with IQ.\nEuler (2018) has recently proposed another theory of how the brain generates g. Rather than focusing on specific brain regions, Euler has built on the predictive processing theory of brain functioning, which posits that the brain is a “prediction machine” that is adapted to help an organism form expectations about the environment and to give attention to events that violate those expectations (e.g., the presence of a danger in a location that the person thought was safe). Euler believes that intelligence may be the manifestation of the brain’s ability to handle unexpected situations and that more intelligent people are better able to manage unexpected events than people with less intelligence. This theory would explain why intelligence differences are more apparent in more complex tasks. Other characteristics of intelligence that predictive processing theory could explain are the positive manifold, why cognitive abilities may form a hierarchy (like in the Cattell–Horn–Carroll model), and why so many different tasks can measure g.\nThis is just a hint at the non-neurological data that support predictive processing theory, and it has the potential to serve as a bridge between the neurology of brain functioning and manifestations of intelligence in people’s behavior. Readers should recognize that predictive processing and P-FIT are not necessarily contradictory. Predictive processing is based mostly on research about brain functioning, while P-FIT is based mostly on brain-imaging data about the size and performance of larger brain regions. It is possible that both theories are correct and that predictive processing explains how the brain generates intelligent behavior while using the regions highlighted in the P-FIT model.\n\n\n\n\nAlfonso, V.

This pattern indicates that intelligence can be measured as a composite score derived from various cognitive abilities.\nThe consistency of this positive correlation, known as the g factor, has been observed even in tests initially designed to measure other traits or abilities. Since it is so easy for cognitive batteries to measure intelligence, some tests that were created with the intention of measuring more narrow abilities end up unintentionally measuring the g-factor. For example, the Cognitive Assessment System (CAS) and the Cognitive Abilities Measurement (CAM) battery were both designed to measure cognitive processes – not g, but they still measure g anyway (keith2001?); (stauffer1996?). Confirmatory factor analysis showed that different cognitive batteries (CAB, Hawaii Battery, WAIS) were analyzed, and it turned out that the g factors computed from the three tests (five tests in Johnson 2008) were statistically indistinguishable from one another, despite the fact that the tests tapped into partly different sets of abilities (johnson2004?); (johnson2008?)."

Other commonly used individual IQ tests (some of which do not label their standard scores as “IQ” scores) include the current versions of the Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales, Woodcock–Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities…\nFor brevity, I will only focus on the first four tests mentioned: WAIS, WISC, SB5, and WJ-IV.\n\n1.2.1 Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)\nAccording to a review by (climie2011?)\n\nInternal consistency. The WAIS-IV’s reliability was measured using split-half and Cronbach’s coefficient alpha. All reported values were based on U.S. norms. The average reliability coefficients for the subtest scores ranged from acceptable (.78) to excellent (≥.90), while the four composite scores had excellent reliability coefficients (all ≥.90), with the FSIQ reporting a reliability coefficient of .98.\nTest-retest reliability. Test-retest reliabilities were obtained using Pearson’s product-moment correlation for four age bands (16-29, 30-54, 55-69, and 70-90), with time intervals between testing ranging from 8 to 82 days and a mean of 22 days. Overall, the WAIS-IV has acceptable stability across time for each of the four age bands. Subtest stability coefficients range from adequate (.74) to excellent (.90), with a majority of scores falling within the good range (.80s). Composite scores ranged from .87 to .96, with the FSIQ stability coefficient reaching an excellent value of .96.\nInterrater reliability. To ascertain acceptable levels of interrater reliability, all WAIS-IV protocols were scored by two independent scorers. General interrater agreement was high (.98 to .99), and for the verbal subtests, raters obtained excellent levels of reliability, ranging from .91 to .97.\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC)\nAccording to a review by (cormier2016?)\n\nThe formula used to calculate internal consistency reliability was recommended by Guilford (1954), Haertel (2006), and Nunnally and Bernstein (1994).\nFisher’s z transformation was used to calculate the average reliability coefficients.\nInternal consistency reliability for composite, subtest, and process scores ranges from r = .80 to r = .96.\nThe split-half method was used to calculate the reliability coefficients for all subtests, except for Coding, Symbol Search, Cancellation, Naming Speed Literacy, Naming Speed Quantity, Immediate Symbol Translation, or Delayed Symbol Translation subtests.\nThe average reliability coefficient for FSIQ is r = .96.\nThe average reliability coefficients for the primary and secondary subtests range from r = .81 to r = .94.\nThe process scores reliability coefficients range from r = .80 to r = .85.\nThe overall reliability coefficients for the primary index scores range from r = .88 to r = .93, and for the ancillary index scores range from r = .92 to r = .95.\nTest-retest reliability coefficients ranged from r = .71 to r = .94, with a mean test-retest interval of 26 days.\nEvidence of inter-scorer agreement was obtained, with the range of inter-scorer agreement being r = .98 to r = .99.\nThe average of the reliability coefficients for primary and secondary subtests from the WISC-VCDN ranges from good to excellent.\nThe reliability estimates for the WISC-VCDN scores demonstrate strong precision, which contributes to minimizing the effects of error in the measurement of the targeted abilities.\n\nAccording to a review by (canivez2016?)\n\nReliability estimates of WISC-V scores reported in the WISC-V Technical and Interpretive Manual were derived using three methods: internal consistency, test-retest (stability), and interscorer agreement.\nInternal consistency was measured through the use of split-half and Cronbach’s coefficient alpha, with data provided for each of the 15 core and supplemental subtests and five composite scores (including the FSIQ).\nTest-retest reliabilities were obtained through repeated administration of the WAIS-IV, with time intervals between testing ranging from 8 to 82 days and a mean of 22 days.\nTo ascertain acceptable levels of interrater reliability, all WAIS-IV protocols were scored by two independent scorers.\nAverage coefficients across the 11 age groups for the composite scores ranged from .88 to .96 and were higher than those obtained for subtests and process scores.\nInternal consistency estimates for the primary and secondary subtests ranged from .81 to .94 while process scores ranged from .80 to .88.\nReliability estimates for the complementary subtests, process, and composite scores are provided.\nStandard errors of measurement based on reliability coefficients are presented in Table 4.4 of the WISC-V Technical and Interpretive Manual.\nShort-term test-retest stability estimates were provided for WISC-V scores where the WISC-V was twice administered to a sample of 218 children.\nInterscorer agreement ranged from .97 to .99.\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales, Fifth Edition (SB-V)\nAccording to a review by (janzen2004?)\n\nThe internal consistency (split-half reliability) for the Full Scale IQ (FSIQ), Nonverbal IQ (NVIQ), and Verbal IQ (VIQ) ranges between .95 and .98; for the five Factor Indices, it is between .90 and .92; and, for the ten subtests, it ranges between .84 and .89.\nIQ scores on the SB:V appear to be quite stable across time and less affected by practice effects.\nThe median inter-scorer correlation is .90, and correlations on multiple-point responses (0, 1, 2) range from .74 to .97.\n\n\n\n1.2.4 Woodcock–Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities\nAccording to a review by (canivez2017?)\n\nInternal consistency reliabilities for untimed tests and dichotomously scored items were estimated with the split-half method, whereas tests with subtests and cluster reliabilities were estimated with Mosier’s (1943) formula for unweighted composites.\nReliability for speeded tests was estimated using the test-retest method with a 1-day retest interval, and correlations were corrected for range restriction.\nMedian reliability coefficients were uniformly high: 38 of 39 were .80 or higher, and 17 were .90 or higher. Test-retest correlations for speeded tests were mostly in the .80 to .90 range.\nCluster scores include two or more tests and as such produce higher reliability estimates as predicted by true score theory. The WJ IV technical manual recommended using cluster scores in interpretation, especially when used in individual decision-making.\nModel-based reliability coefficients (omega hierarchical) could be assessed to determine unique true score variance captured by the different scores.\nAlternate forms equivalence was examined and item difficulty and content were found to be similar among the forms.\n\nAccording to (madle2017?)\n\nMedian internal consistency coefficient for WJ IV COG GIA score is .97, with median coefficients of .95 to .97 for different age groups\nGf-Gc reliability coefficients range from .94 to .98 (median = .96)\nBIA reliability coefficient median is .94 (.92-.95)\nMedian coefficients for the various cognitive clusters range from .86 (Visual Processing) to .91 (Short-Term Working Memory)\nOral Language reliability coefficients range from .89 for Oral Expression to .92 for Broad Oral Language\nAcademic cluster median reliability coefficients range from .92 to .97, with a Broad Achievement score median reliability coefficient of .99\nTest-retest studies were completed for speeded tests only, and median reliability coefficients ranged from .88 to .92 for three different age groups\nEquivalence of item difficulties and item content for the achievement forms was examined and found to be strong."

During scale construction, developers were careful to identify and exam-ine any incorrect responses that were frequently given (e.g., items on Matrix Reasoning) to deter-mine whether there were alternate correct solutions. Changes to items or answers were created based on the responses of the examinees. Additionally, developers asked examinees about the problem-solving strategies that they had utilized during test administration.\nExaminee responses were considered when determining final items to be included in the WAIS-IV.\nInternal structure During the research process, extreme care was taken to review current theo-retical literature to ensure that newly created subtests were formed with strong validity. Strong interrelationships among all subtests, both new items and those previously used, provide strong support for the internal structure and validity of this measure. Factor analysis procedures were used to confirm that the newly created subtests aligned with previous indices. Additionally, ade-quate psychometric support was found for a four-factor model, as indicated by both the technical manual (Wechsler, 2008) and through further independent research (Benson, Hulac, & Kranzler, 2010; Bowden, Saklofske, & Weiss, 2011; Canivez & Watkins, 2010)\nCorrelations with other tests The WAIS-IV was co-normed with a number of other assessment measures to examine both convergent and discriminant validity. Of particular importance, scores on the WAIS-IV subtests demonstrated strong correlations with those from the WAIS-III, with subtest correlations ranging from .65 to .90. Additionally, correlations between composite scores also indicated high consistency (range .83 to .91).\nThe WAIS-IV was also correlated with a number of other measures, including commonly used measures of cognitive ability, achievement, memory, and attention. Overall conclusions indicate that the WAIS-IV correlated highly with instruments purported to measure similar con-structs but generally did not correlate with measures that did not examine intelligence.\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC)\n\n\n1.3.3 Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales, Fifth Edition (SB-V)\n\n\n1.3.4 Woodcock–Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities"

    "text": "2.2 Evidences of test bias in intelligence tests\nThere has been much debate around the potential bias of intelligence tests. However, research has consistently shown that intelligence tests, when administered and scored correctly, are not biased against any particular group or population.\nIn fact, intelligence tests are designed to be culturally fair and measure cognitive abilities that are not tied to any specific cultural or socioeconomic group. The tests are created using a rigorous process that involves extensive pilot testing, item analysis, and psychometric evaluation.\nExpert opinion finds that “the issue of test bias is scientifically dead” (Hunter and Schmidt 2000, 151) “There exists, in contrast to the position of the late 1960s, a substantial body of research addressing the cultural test bias hypothesis, and scholars have extensively reviewed this literature in book and chapter-length forums (A. R. Jensen 1980); (Cecil R. Reynolds 1995); (Cecil R. Reynolds 1998); (Cecil R. Reynolds and Brown 1984). Essentially, these reviews have concluded that well-constructed, reliable, well-standardized psychological tests are not biased against native-born American racial or ethnic minorities. Studies of cultural bias in testing do occasionally reveal bias in some aspects of validity, but the bias is more likely to favor minorities in a predictive context” (Cecil R. Reynolds 2000);(Cecil R. Reynolds and Suzuki 2012)\nIn 1982, the National Research Council and the National Academy of Sciences found that “ability tests predict equally well for all groups of test takers. Research evidence does not support the notion that tests systematically underpredict the performance of minority group members” (Wigdor 1982) In 1994, Mainstream Science on Intelligence, a statement issued by several researchers, finds that “Intelligence tests are not culturally biased against American blacks or other native-born, English-speaking peoples in the U.S. Rather, IQ scores predict equally accurately for all such Americans, regardless of race and social class. Individuals who do not understand English well can be given either a nonverbal test or one in their native language.” (Gottfredson 1997). In 1996, the American Psychological Association found that “considered as predictors of future performance, the tests do not seem to be biased against African Americans.” (Neisser et al. 1996). (Reeve and Charles 2008) found that there is a consensus among intelligence experts that cognitive ability tests are not bias against minority groups\nAnd most important of all: logical and empirical examination: If intelligence tests merely measure knowledge or conformity to Western middle-class culture is the fact that the racial group with the highest average on these tests is not Europeans, but East Asians; this has been true since the 1920s (Goodenough 1926). If intelligence tests measure acculturation to Western culture, then indigenous communities who have had more contact with Europeans should score higher than people in communities in the same nation who have had less contact. However, this is not the case (Porteus 1965).\nContent of many test formats (e.g., matrix tests, digit span) contains very little information that is unique to Western culture. It is not clear how numbers or geometric patterns are special to Western middle-class individuals. Expert rated culturally loaded test items do not contribute to an increase in the Black/White divide. (Arthur R. Jensen 1987) If test items were culturally loaded, (especially to a degree that would significantly change test results) this would mean test items ranked by difficulty would not correlate well by race. However, the opposite is true. (Cecil R. Reynolds and Suzuki 2012) Correlation of rank order difficulty between cognitive batteries is nearly perfect among Blacks and Whites."

(Schimmack 2017) We have even had papers that are completely fabricated (probably for political motivation). (Flores et al. 2021) We have a few meta analyses on this phenomenon. Publication bias plagues many of these studies and when factored for, the effect sizes decrease. (Flore and Wicherts 2015);(Shewach, Sackett, and Quint 2019), a meta-analysis of 212 experimental studies on stereotype threat, which included a total of more than 10,000 adult participants effects (the largest to date) ‘range[d] from negligible to small’ If we assume stereotype threat is an actual possible influential factor, we would actually expect Black people to have increased scores as they measure higher than whites on various psychological metrics\nCompared to Whites, Blacks have higher self-esteem (Twenge and Crocker 2002), Lower suicide rates (Curtin, Brown, and Jordan 2022), Lower rates of stress (Krueger, Saint Onge, and Chang 2011), Lower risk for panic disorder, Lower risk for generalized anxiety order, Lower risk for social phobia (Breslau et al. 2006), Lower rates for depressive disorder (Riolo et al. 2005), Lower overall rate of mental disorders (Coleman et al. 2016). Since Black people are more confident and mentally healthy, it doesn’t seem like stereotype threat could be a relevant factor. In conclusion: the evidence points to there being no cultural bias in IQ testing and there doesn’t seem to be enough methodologically robust literature to make a certain claim on stereotype threat (though more recent analyses that factor for publication bias show null effects). The burden of proof rests on those who claim this to significantly affect the gap between blacks and whites."

    "text": "2.4 Do scientists actually believe in general intelligence?\nThe theory of IQ as the measure of general intelligence is mainstream. The American Psychological Association’s authoritative task force on intelligence stated that the theory of general intelligence is “the most widely accepted current view” (Neisser et al. 1996, 81).\nFifty-eight percent of APA respondents favor some form of a general intelligence solution, whereas 13% feel separate faculties are superior. Only 16% think the data are sufficiently ambiguous as to not favor either solution. (Snyderman and Rothman 1987, 140)\nMainstream Science on Intelligence, a Wallstreet Journal editorial with 52 signatories of 25 conclusions that represent the mainstream, Gottfredson writes that “Intelligence is a very general mental capability … it reflects a broader and deeper capability for comprehending our surroundings …” Of the invitation sent out to 131 researchers, only 11 responded that one or more of the conclusions did not represent the mainstream. (Gottfredson 1997)\nIn a conference attended by leading experts on human intelligence Michael Rutter, who is known for his moderate views, said: “All of us accept [g’s] reality. It is not merely a statistical artifact, rather, it really does represent something that is biologically important” (Rutter 2000, 282). One of the most prominent critics of general intelligence had to concede: “The evidence in favor of a general factor of intelligence is, in one sense, overwhelming … One would have to be blind or intransigent not to give this evidence its due” (Sternberg 2003, 375)\nMost recently, a survey of expert opinion on intelligence finds that “76% favored a general factor perspective” noting that “Experts favored a g factor perspective” (Rindermann, Becker, and Coyle 2020, 4)\n\n\n\n\nBreslau, Joshua, Sergio Aguilar-Gaxiola, Kenneth S.

    "section": "3.1 Threshold hypothesis",
    "text": "3.1 Threshold hypothesis\nThe “threshold hypothesis” states that increased IQ does not lead to additional benefits- though the actual line of the threshold is disputed. (Gladwell 2008) states that the threshold is at an IQ of 120 (which would mean mathematically that over 90 percent of the population experience noticeable benefits with higher IQ). A different estimate by (Feldman 1984) says that the threshold is about IQ 150 (which excludes less than 1 percent of the population).\nBased on the best available research, the threshold hypothesis is incorrect. Data from large samples of high-IQ people show that the likelihood of beneficial life outcomes continues to increase as people get smarter. The best research on the threshold hypothesis comes from SMPY. In the SMPY sample, there are over 2,300 people who have IQs of 135 or higher – the top 1% of the population. Even within this bright group, IQ was positively correlated with favorable work and educational outcomes. For sample members in the top quarter of the top 1%, the odds of earning a doctorate were 3.56 times higher than for people whose IQ was “only” in the bottom quarter of the top 1%. In the SMPY sample, the odds of a person in the brighter group were also higher for having an income in the top 5% of incomes nationwide (2.31 times greater); earning a patent (3.01 times greater); publishing a literary work (4.55 times greater); and publishing scholarly work in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (4.97 times greater). There was no apparent threshold where the probability of any accomplishments leveled off or decreased (Lubinski 2009). Selecting an even higher threshold of an IQ of 156 (the top 0.01% of the population, or the top 1 in 10,000 people) does not diminish the threshold effect. Over 50% of SMPY sample members with IQs of 156 or higher earned doctorates, while “only” 30% of the top 0.5% (IQ of 139 or higher) earned a doctorate (Lubinski 2009) (In comparison, 1.8% of the US adult population has earned a doctorate).\nMoreover, people with IQ scores in the top 1 in 10,000 rise to the top echelons of leadership and productivity in their careers at such a high rate that, “many are outstanding creators of modern culture, constituting a precious human-capital resource” (Kell, Lubinski, and Benbow 2013, 648). The results of SMPY have been replicated. (Wai 2014, 76) found that within a sample of 1,536 teenagers with IQ scores in the top 1% (IQ of 135 or higher), the smartest 25% earned doctorates at a rate that was 1.52 times. greater than the least intelligent 25%. Another sample of individuals with IQs in the top 1 in 10,000 of the population had similar levels of high education achievement, work productivity, and eminence within their fields as was found in the SMPY sample (Makel et al. 2016). (Coyle 2015) reported data from two studies on the relationship between intelligence and college grade point averages and found that the correlation was constant across the entire range of intelligence levels. In other words, there was no point at which greater levels of intelligence failed to increase the probability of a high grade point average in college. In a sample of gifted children, (Ruf 2005) found that as IQ increased, children were better able to move through the K-12 curriculum quickly and were increasingly more likely to display early academic development, such as learning to read by age. Successively brighter groups also mastered advanced academic material at younger and younger ages. Another study that disproves the threshold hypothesis showed that in a large sample of medical school graduates higher scores on achievement tests needed to obtain a medical license were always associated with higher levels of competence in practice (Wakeford et al. 2018)."

    "text": "3.2 Aren’t people with higher IQs more likely to be mentally ill?\nFor social and emotional outcomes, there is not much evidence about whether an IQ threshold exists. In the best study on this topic (Guldemond et al. 2007), children above IQs of 130 and 144 did not have more social or emotional problems than children with IQs in the 110s and 120s. Ironically, the evidence indicates that high intelligence may be a protective factor against at least some forms of psychiatric illness (Savage et al. 2018); (Walker et al. 2002). This is especially apparent in GWAS results, which show that some of the DNA segments associated with higher IQ are often negatively correlated with mental health problems (Hill et al. 2019); (Savage et al. 2018); (Sniekers et al. 2017), which makes it especially unlikely that people with very high IQs experience more psychiatric illnesses. An important exception to this general trend is autism spectrum disorder, which seems to share some genes in common with high intelligence (Hill et al. 2019); (Savage et al. 2018); (Sniekers et al. 2017). (Williams et al. 2022) finds that high intelligence is not a risk factor for mental health disorders"

    "text": "Firstly, we have to understand that IQ is designed to be a measurement of intelligence. Like all models, it is subject to noise. The interplay between intelligence and socioeconomic status is complicated and should be treated as such. Firstly, we know that intelligence and socioeconomic status correlate but this, however, does not necessarily imply causation in any specific direction.\n(Sirin 2005) meta-analyzed data on roughly 100,000 students and found the mean correlation between cognitive ability and parental SES to be .28, indicating a moderate relationship. (Neisser et al. 1996) from the American Psychological Association task force report on intelligence explains that these two variables influence each other. A meta-analytic review of the longitudinal research on IQ and SES, found that the mean correlations between a person’s IQ measured at one point and their education, occupation status, and income, measured 10 or more years later, were .49, .41, and .22 respectively. This is significant because they were better predictors than their parental socioeconomic status. (Strenze 2007); (Murray 1998) analyzed data from the NLSY and showed that IQ differences within sibling pairs predicted future differences in SES. That is, the sibling with a higher IQ typically ended up having more education, a higher status occupation, and more income.\nBecause siblings have identical parental SES, this analysis shows that IQ leads to higher SES independent of parental SES. This is also recorded in (Lubinski 2009).\nTwin studies can additionally give insight on the variation of intelligence attributed to the common or shared environment. Common environmental influence, which includes familial socioeconomic status, influences 25 percent the variability and decreases to around 15 percent of the variability in young adulthood- the maximum amount of influence that socioeconomic factors from family could play. (Haworth et al. 2010)\nActing as a natural experiment, some evidence shows that adoption may raise IQ since adoption into a highly favorable environment would be described as an “intensive, years-long intervention that includes academic, social, and health improvements throughout childhood and adolescence” (Warne 2020) However, this kind of adoption as stated above seems to increase IQ scores of around 4 points. (Kendler et al. 2015) (though this may not be in g itself (te Nijenhuis, Jongeneel-Grimen, and Armstrong 2015)). More generally, (McGue et al. 2007) studies adoptive and non adoptive families, each consisting of an adolescent sibling pair and one or both of their parents (with comparable age and gender). This study does not find that socioeconomic status is a causal element in determining intelligence.\n\n\n\n\nHaworth, C. M. A., M. J. Wright, M. Luciano, N. G. Martin, E. J. C. de Geus, C. E.

    "text": "5.1 Are positive intercorrelations from test design?\nThere are many cognitive batteries that specifically do not try to look for ‘g’, some of which expressly try to avoid it.\n\nResearchers for the British Ability Scales lament that “there is little evidence that strong primary factors… have accounted for any substantial proportion of the common variance of the British Ability Scales. This is despite the fact that the scales sample a wide range of psychological functions.” It asks What, then, are we to make of the results of these analyses? Do they mean that we are back to square one, as it were, and that after 60 years of research we have turned full circle and are back with the theories of Spearman?” (Elliott 1986).\nThe CAS Battery is based on the Soviet inspired PASS theory which disavows g and asserts that intelligence consists of four processes called Planning, Attention-Arousal, Simultaneous, and Successive. The CAS was designed to assess these four processes. However, (Keith, Kranzler, and Flanagan 2001) did a joint confirmatory factor analysis of the CAS together with the WJ-III battery, concluding that not only does the CAS not measure the constructs it was designed to measure, but that notwithstanding the test makers’ aversion to g, the g factor derived from the CAS is large and statistically indistinguishable from the g factor of the WJ-III. The CAS therefore appears to be the opposite of what it was supposed to be: an excellent test of the “non-existent” g and a poor test of the supposedly real non-g abilities it was painstakingly designed to measure.\nThe triarchic theory of intelligence originated as an alternative to the concept of general intelligence factor, or g. (Vinney 2021); (Brody 2003a), (Brody 2003b) analyzed Sternbergs work and finds a general factor of intelligence. Additionally, with tests that are radically different, Confirmatory Factor Analysis showed that different cognitive batteries (CAB, Hawaii Battery, WAIS) were analyzed, and it turned out that the g factors computed from the three tests (five tests in (Johnson, Nijenhuis, and Bouchard 2008)) were statistically indistinguishable from one another, despite the fact that the tests tapped into partly different sets of abilities. (Johnson et al. 2004), (Johnson, Nijenhuis, and Bouchard 2008).\n\nThe significance of this “positive manifold” is that we would not expect someone who is good at one cognitive test to just be good at all of them."

    "section": "5.2 Other evidence for g",
    "text": "5.2 Other evidence for g\n\n5.2.1 Jensen effects\nPractical validity: General intelligence is a good predictor of several seemingly unrelated life outcomes. For example, IQ is the best single predictor of academic and job performance and attainment, and one of the best predictors of a plethora of other outcomes, from income, welfare dependency, and criminality (Gottfredson 1997) to health and mortality and scientific and literary creativity (Robertson et al. 2010), and any number of other things, including even investing success (Grinblatt, Keloharju, and Linnainmaa 2012). If you had to predict the life outcomes of a teenager based on only one fact about them, nothing would be nearly as informative as their IQ.\nOne interesting thing about the predictive validity of a cognitive test is that it is directly related to the test’s g loading. The higher the g loading, the better the validity. In fact, although the g factor generally accounts for less than half of all the variance in a given IQ battery, a lot of research indicates that it accounts for almost all of the predictive validity. The best evidence here are from several large-scale studies of US Air Force personnel. These studies contrasted g and a number of more specific abilities as predictors of performance in Air Force training (Malcom James Ree and Earles 1991) and jobs (Malcolm James Ree, Earles, and Teachout 1994). The results indicated that g is the best predictor of training and job performance across all specialties, and that specific ability tests tailored for each specialty provide little or no incremental validity over g. Thus if you wanted to predict someone’s performance in training or a job, it would be much more useful for you to get their general mental ability score rather than scores on any specific ability tests that are closely matched to the task at hand. This appears to be true in all jobs (Schmidt and Hunter 1998); (Schmidt and Hunter 2004), although specific ability scores may provide substantial incremental validity in the case of high-IQ individuals (Robertson et al. 2010), which is in accord with Charles Spearman’s view that abilities become more differentiated at higher levels of g. (This is why it makes sense for selective colleges to use admission tests that assess different abilities.)\nFor more evidence of how general the predictive validity of g is, we can look at the validity of g as a predictor of performance in GCSEs (General Certificate of Secondary Education), which are academic qualifications awarded in different school subjects at age 14 to 16 in the United Kingdom. (Deary et al. 2007) conducted a prospective study with a very large sample where g was measured at age 11 and GCSEs were obtained about five years later. The g scores correlated positively and substantially with the results of all 25 GCSEs, explaining (to give some examples) about 59 percent of individual differences in math, about 40 to 50 percent in English and foreign languages, and, at the low end, about 18 percent in Art and Design. In contrast, verbal ability, independently of g, explained an average of only 2.2 percent (range 0.0-7.2%) of the results in the 25 exams.\nArthur Jensen referred to g as the “active ingredient” of IQ tests, because g accounts for most if not all of the predictive validity of IQ even though most variance in IQ tests is not g variance. From the perspective of predictive validity, non-g variance seems to be generally just noise. In other words, if you statistically remove g variance from IQ test results, what is left is almost useless for the purposes of predicting behavior (except among high-IQ individuals, as noted above). This is a very surprising finding if one thinks that different mental abilities are actually independent, and g is just an uninteresting statistical artifact caused by an occasional recruitment of many uncorrelated abilities for the same task.\nHollowness of IQ training effects\nAnother interesting fact about g is that there is there is a systematic relation between g loadings and practice effects in IQ tests. A meta-analysis of re-testing effects on IQ scores showed that there is a perfect negative correlation between score gains and g loadings of tests (te Nijenhuis, van Vianen, and van der Flier 2007). It appears that specific abilities are trainable but g is generally not (see also Arendasy and Sommer (2013)). Similarly, a recent meta-analysis of the effects of working memory training on intelligence showed, in line with many earlier reviews, that cognitive training produces short-term gains in the specific abilities trained, but no “far transfer” to any other abilities (Melby-Lervåg and Hulme 2013). Jensen called such gains hollow because they do not seem to represent actual improvements in real-world intellectual performance. These findings are consistent with the view that g is a “central processing unit” that cannot be defined in terms of specific abilities and is not affected by changes in those abilities.\n\n\n5.2.2 Quantitative genetic correlates\nOn a biological level, cognitive abilities are heritable. (Polderman et al. 2015) Higher g-loadings correlate to higher heritabilities (Jensen 1987),(J. P. Rushton et al. 2007), (Van Bloois et al. 2009),(te Nijenhuis, Kura, and Hur 2014). Quantitative genetic analyses indicate that g is an even stronger genetic variable than it is a phenotypic variable. (Plomin and Spinath 2004) states,\n“Multivariate genetic analysis yields a statistic called genetic correlation, which is an index of the extent to which genetic effects on one trait correlate with genetic effects on another trait independent of the heritability of the two traits. That is, two traits could be highly heritable but the genetic correlation between them could be zero. Conversely, two traits could be only modestly heritable but the genetic correlation between them could be 1.0, indicating that even though genetic effects are not strong (because heritability is modest) the same genetic effects are involved in both traits. In the case of specific cognitive abilities that are moderately heritable, multivariate genetic analyses have consistently found that genetic correlations are very high—close to 1.0 (Petrill 1997). That is, although Spearman’s g is a phenotypic construct, g is even stronger genetically. These multivariate genetic results predict that when genes are found that are associated with one cognitive ability, such as spatial ability, they will also be associated just as strongly with other cognitive abilities, such as verbal ability or memory. Conversely, attempts to find genes for specific cognitive abilities independent of general cognitive ability are unlikely to succeed because what is in common among cognitive abilities is largely genetic and what is independent is largely environmental.”\n\n\n5.2.3 Neurobiological correlates\nThe controversy if brain anatomy correlates with intelligence has existed for decades but since the 1980s some neuroscientists have worked to bridge the gap between these two fields, and in the twenty-first century their evidence and theories support the belief that g does indeed have connections to brain anatomy and functioning twenty-first century their evidence and theories support the belief that g does indeed have connections to brain anatomy and functioning (Haier 2017).\nBrain Volume\nThere are brain characteristics that do correlate with IQ scores. One of the best known is the correlation between brain size and intelligence, which when measured via brain-imaging techniques in living individuals is between r = .20 and .40. Other measures of brain size (e.g., data from autopsies, or measures of head circumference) have weaker, though positive, correlations (Cox et al. 2019); (Gignac and Bates 2017); (Lee et al. 2019); (Pietschnig et al. 2015); (J. Rushton and Ankney 2009). A 2022 meta-analysis ultimately states that most reasonable estimates for the brain size and IQ link yield r-values in the mid-0.20s, with the most extreme specifications yielding rs of 0.10 and 0.37. (Pietschnig et al. 2022). Additionally, measures of the size of the whole brain are more strongly correlated than measures of specific brain regions. It is important, though, to note that the size of the frontal lobes seems more strongly correlated with IQ than other regions of the brain (Cox et al. 2019); (Flashman et al. 1997).\nThere seems to be some sort of association with g since better measures of g produce stronger correlations with brain size (Gignac and Bates 2017), (Pietschnig et al. 2022). The relationship between brain volume and IQ is clearly complex and seems to be modestly moderated by g. (Woodley of Menie et al. 2016)\nOther Brain Characteristics\nSince the 1990s, neuroscientists have discovered more variables correlated with IQ. For example, research has shown the importance of the white matter in the brain, which is the tissue that connects brain regions to one another. Volume of white matter is correlated with speed of problem solving (Penke et al. 2012) and with IQ, thus showing that connectivity of brain regions is likely to be an important determinant of intelligence levels (Haier 2017); (Kievit et al. 2016). Likewise, grey matter (where the neuron cell bodies are found) is important; loss of neurons due to disease is associated with decreases in IQ (Veluw et al. 2012). Additionally, smarter people have more neurons in their brains, and those neurons are more densely packed together (Genç et al. 2018). Another intriguing recent finding is that neurons are better organized in high-IQ ndividuals’ brains than in the brains of people who score poorly on intelligence tests.\n\n\n\n\nArendasy, Martin E., and Markus Sommer. 2013. “Quantitative Differences in Retest Effects Across Different Methods Used to Construct Alternate Test Forms.” Intelligence 41 (3): 181–92. https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2013.02.004.\n\n\nBrody, Nathan. 2003a. “Construct Validation of the Sternberg Triarchic Abilities Test: Comment and Reanalysis.” Intelligence 31 (4): 319–29. https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1016/S0160-2896(01)00087-3.\n\n\n———. 2003b. “What Sternberg Should Have Concluded.” Intelligence 31 (4): 339–42. https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1016/S0160-2896(02)00190-3.\n\n\nCox, S.

    "text": "1.1 Don’t we have multiple intelligences?\nThe theory of multiple intelligences proposes the differentiation of human intelligence into specific intelligences, rather than defining intelligence as a single, general ability. (gardner2011?)\nGardner, the creator of the theory of multiple intelligences states that “I readily admit that the theory [of multiple intelligences] is no longer current. Several fields of knowledge have advanced significantly since the early 1980s. Any reinvigoration of the theory would require a survey similar to the one that colleagues and I carried out thirty-five years ago.” (sternberg2016?). (hunt2010?) p. 119, stated that “there is virtually no objective evidence for the theory” of multiple intelligences. Gardner believes that those who espose general intelligence are “bad guys”. (gardner2009?) Gardner seems to have called the abilities in his model, “intelligences” in order to “replace the current, [allegedly] largely discredited notion of intelligence as a single inherited trait” (gardner2011?).\nBy including physical abilities (in bodily-kinesthetic intelligence), personality traits (in interpersonal intelligence) and other non-cognitive traits, Gardner has stretched the word “intelligence” so much that it ceases to have any real meaning (hunt2010?);(jensen1998?);(scarr1985?). Gardner sees g as being a narrow concept that encourages “a limited view of intelligence” (vonkaroli2002?), but believing in the existence of g does not preclude the existence of other abilities. In fact, both the currently accepted model of intelligence, the Cattell-Horn-Carroll model and bifactor models explicitly recognize the existence of non-g cognitive abilities\nIn order to make the theory of Multiple Intelligences, Gardner habitually cherry picks evidence in his favor and ignores evidence that contradicts his theory (bouchard1984?); (messick1992?); (scarr1985?); (snow1985?). Frames of Mind also has the drawback of relying heavily on anecdotal data rather than any large, representative sample of individuals performing tasks grounded in his intelligences (lubinski1995?).\nGardner’s theory is also unfalsifiable. Gardener states that he has “never felt that MI theory was one that could be subjected to an ‘up and down’ kind of test, or even series of tests” (gardner2011?). And that he “[does] not believe that educational programs created under the aegis of MI theory lend themselves to the kinds of randomized control studies that the US government is now calling for in education” (gardner2011?). Gardner has stated that he does not endorse any psychological test to measure the multiple intelligences (vonkaroli2002?)."

    "section": "1.2 Isn’t Emotional Intelligence or EQ more powerful than IQ?",
    "text": "1.2 Isn’t Emotional Intelligence or EQ more powerful than IQ?\nEmotional Intelligence, “the capacity to reason, understand, and manage emotions. In addition, emotional intelligence plausibly reflects the emotion system’s capacity to use emotion to enhance thought”. Goleman describes it as “the ability to identify, monitor and accurately use information about emotional states” After Goleman’s 1996 book, “Emotional Intelligence”, the popular psychological term became a multi-million dollar industry. (grewal2005?) This fad (murphy2006?), like other fads in psychology, is unsubstantiated by the literature. Emotional Intelligence is not actually an independent construct, it seems to just measure various other factors that predict success. (joseph2015?) reports that “62% of the variance in mixed EI is captured by Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Emotional Stability, ability EI, cognitive ability, general self-efficacy, and self-rated job performance.” which are all factors that predict success. This is also explored in (landy2005?).\nEmotional Intelligence’s construct validity is in question as some show it may merely be a repackaged version of the Big Five personality traits (conte2005?); (canderlinden2018?).\n(davies1998?) states “Our searches of the literature revealed only six articles in which the authors either explicitly examined the incremental validity of EI scores over measures of both cognitive ability and Big Five personality traits in predicting either academic or work performance, or presented data in a manner that allowed examination of this issue. Not one of these six articles… showed a significant contribution for EI in the prediction of performance after controlling for both cognitive ability and the Big Five…\nFor correlations involving the overall EI construct, EI explained almost no incremental variance in performance [change in prediction] = .00. Findings were identical when considering only cases involving an ability-based measure of IE….”.\n(harms2010?) states “…proofs of validity [for EI] seem to come from measuring constructs that have existed for a long time and are simply being relabeled and recategorized. For example, one of the proposed measures of (Emotional and Social Competence), the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire, makes use of measures of assertiveness, social competence, self-confidence, stress management, and impulsivity among other things. Most, if not all, of these constructs, are firmly embedded in and well-accounted for by [other] well-designed measures of personality traits…\nThe substantial relationships observed between these ESC (Emotional and Social Competence) and trait-based EI measures, and personality inventories bear this out. It, therefore, appears that the predictive validity of ESC or EI measures may be accounted for in large part by the degree to which they assess sub-facets of higher-order traits relevant to the outcomes being predicted."

    "text": "1.3 Is IQ the only trait that predicts outcomes?\nAlthough intelligence is important in determining a student’s level of academic success, no one claims that intelligence is the only trait that impacts school outcomes. The correlation between IQ and measures of academic success – such as grades, standardized test scores, or how many years a person stays in school – is not perfect. That means that there is room for other abilities to exert an impact on educational performance. As (gottfredson1997b?) p.116 states, “The effects of intelligence … are probabilistic, not deterministic. Higher intelligence improves the odds of success in school and work. It is an advantage, not a guarantee. Many other things matter.” It is not difficult to brainstorm a list of what these “other things” that influence success are. Psychological traits like motivation, creativity, resiliency, curiosity, industriousness, and ambition can all be important for doing well in school. Non-psychological variables like socioeconomic status, parental involvement in education, a culture that encourages academic competition, and good physical health could also have an impact on a student’s success (warne2016?). Nobody denies this- but whether or not these variables\nThe argument among psychologists and educators is not whether non-cognitive variables can result in higher school performance. Rather, the argument is over the magnitude of the influence that these non-cognitive variables have and whether these variables are more important than intelligence in determining educational success. Personality traits have moderate importance in determining school performance, but they are hard to change. This resistance to interventions is probably because personality traits are – like almost every other psychological trait – partially influenced by genes. The heritability of personality is roughly the same as the heritability of intelligence, which may limit the malleability of personality (bouchard1997?); (bouchard2004?); (briley2017?). Because of the difficulty of improving school performance by altering personality, many psychologists seek non-cognitive characteristics that are both malleable and important causes of academic achievement.\n\n1.3.1 Personality traits\nThe leading theory for personality, the Five Factor model, these traits are present in many cultures and across the lifespan, and they are a robust basis for understanding personality (allik2017?). Psychologists have conducted a great deal of research on the correlation between Big Five traits and school success. Although not perfectly consistent, this research shows that some of these traits correlate with educational outcomes. Conscientiousness has the strongest correlation, usually between r ≈ .20 and .35 (e.g., (cucina2016?); (lechner2017?); (poropat2009?); (spinath2010?)). While this is a strong enough correlation for conscientiousness to be a noteworthy influence on school performance, it is weaker than the correlation between intelligence and academic performance, which is usually r ≈ .35 to .70 in the same studies. This indicates that intelligence is a more important influence on educational performance than conscientiousness is. The other personality traits in the Big Five have weaker relationships – in some studies as weak as zero – with academic achievement.\n\n\n1.3.2 Motivation\nThere is no denying the benefits of motivation. As one of the best non-cognitive influences on academics (rosen2010?); (liu2012?), it is no surprise we see that motivated people set higher goals and accomplish more goals (locke2002?). Policies that encourage motivation in children result in greater dedication to their studies and higher performance in school (e.g., (patall2008?); (roderick2001?)).\nMotivation, school performance, and IQ are all positively correlated with one another, and it is often difficult to disentangle their influences. In regards to intelligence, research shows that highly motivated examinees earn slightly higher IQ scores (gignac2019?). And because staying in school longer raises IQ (ceci1991?); (ritchie2018?), it is possible that academically motivated students – who choose to stay in school longer – might earn higher IQs because of their additional education. However, none of this is evidence for whether increased motivation can cause higher g. Controlling for intelligence sometimes makes the relationship between motivation and academic performance disappear (e.g., (ziegler2010?)), though not always. And it is possible that motivation’s impact on IQ is entirely on the non-g influences on test scores. It does seem clear that improving student motivation can lead to gains in educational performance (rosen2010?). Motivation seems to have a stronger effect on grades than on standardized test scores (e.g., (cucina2016?)), possibly because earning high grades requires more sustained effort. Regardless, intelligence seems to be the more important predictor, no matter how academic performance is measured. As the authors of one study stated, “cognitive abilities were by far the best predictor of school achievement” (gagné2001?). Motivation – important as it is in determining academic outcomes – still is dwarfed by the influence of intelligence and other cognitive abilities. Therefore, no amount of motivation can make up for a large IQ deficit.\n\n\n1.3.3 Mindset\nAccording to Dweck, there are two types of mindset: (a) fixed mindset and (b) growth mindset. (dweck2009?). There are several things that growth mindset are set out to achieve, most of which are minor or even associated with negative effects. Growth mindset is only slightly associated with goal setting. (burgoyne2020?) finds a correlation of 0.1 between having a growth mind-set and holding learning goals. For comparison, other personality constructs have been found to correlate much more strongly with learning goal orientation: self-efficacy (r = .56), need for achievement (r = .38), and openness to experience (r = .34); (payne2007?). Conversely, (burgoyne2020?) finds no statistically significant associations between having a fixed-mindset and and performance goals. People with growth mindsets are not more intelligent. If anything, it is the opposite. (macnamara2017?) find a insignificant correlation between mind-set and intelligence RMP (β = -0.04) (burgoyne2020?) interestingly finds that mind-set has a very small negative correlation with cognitive ability tests. CFIT-4 (β = -0.10), Letter sets (β = -0.11), RPM (β = -0.12) People with growth mindset do not achieve more. (bahník2017?) using university applicants who took an exam on scholastic aptitude (N = 5653) finds that growth mind-set was not positively associated with results of the test, did not predict change of the results for those who retook the test, did not predict participation in a future administration of the test, nor could it predict the total number of tests taken. (sisk2018?), finds only a small correlation between mind-set and academic achievement (r = 0.1 and r=.08). (li2020?) find no association between growth mind-set and academic achievement. Growth mindset does not improve resilience- if anything, it is negatively associated with resilience. Li and Bates 2019; (burgoyne2020?)\n\n\n1.3.4 Grit\nGrit, formulated by Angela Duckworth, is perseverance and passion for long-term goals. (duckworth2007?) Grit seems to be extremely similar to the Big 5 trait, “conscientiousness”. The two traits correlate at = .66 to .84 (crede2016?). This correlation is so high that it indicates that there is little, if anything, new about grit at all. It is probably just a repackaged version of conscientiousness. A growing body of research studies shows that grit has no unique properties compared to more established non-cognitive variables (e.g., (dixson2016?); (usher2019?)). Grit also does not seem like it can be grown. (rimfeld2016?) finds that grit was substantially heritable, but found no evidence for a shared environmental influence on grit. (rimfeld2016?) p. 786 explained that “[t]he most limiting finding, for any possible intervention, is that shared environmental influence is negligible”. Regardless, intelligence contributes 48-90 times more than grit and has a negligible effect on educational and economic success (zisman2021?). (crede2016?) p.501 conducted a meta-analysis investigating the influence of grit and other traits on academic achievement, and found that while conscientiousness explained variance in academic achievement after controlling for grit, “overall grit explains no variance in either overall academic performance or high school GPA after controlling for conscientiousness”"

    "text": "1.4 What about mutualism?\nMutualism, which states that “cognitive processes are initially uncorrelated, but that the positive manifold arises during individual development due to mutual beneficial relations between cognitive processes.”, has no good empirical backing. Mutualism expects that “it takes some time for the positive manifold, and thus the psychometric g factor, to emerge”, (vandermaas2006?) but conversely, the proportion of variance in scale scores accounted for by a general factor is stable from age 2.5-90 (gignac2014?); (thompson1985?) even finds evidence for a genetic ‘g’ among infants. Mutualism would expect low genetic correlations among cognitive domains, however, more g-loaded tests are more heritable than the less g-loaded tests (and this exists in non humans as well). This is incredibly problematic. For example, in children, “correlations between phenotypic g loadings and genetic g loadings were 0.88 and 0.76 for the two mental test batteries.” (deary2006?) Additionally, “the effect of being raised in the same family is smaller than the effect of genes.” (Second Law of Behavioral Genetics) Mutualism fails to pass lex parsimoniae, is not generalisable, is not falsifiable, and is based mostly on post-hoc justifications (gignac2016?). Finally, under mutualism, we would expect changes to ‘g’ occurring after social changes and environmental impacts. However, IQ gains from adoption are not g-loaded, (tenijenhuis2015?) IQ changes with education are not g-loaded (tenijenhuis2014b?); (ritchie2015?), etc."

    "text": "What heritability does not mean\n\nHeritability does not indicate what proportion of a trait is determined by genes and what proportion is determined by environment. So, a heritability of 0.7 does not mean that a trait is 70% caused by genetic factors; it means that 70% of the variability in the trait in a population is due to genetic differences among people.\nKnowing the heritability of a trait does not necessarily provide information about which genes or environmental influences are involved, or how important they are in determining the trait.\nHeritable is not necessarily the same as familial. A trait is described as familial if it is shared by members of a family. Traits can appear in families for many reasons in addition to genetics, such as similarities in lifestyle and environment. For example, the language that is spoken tends to be shared in families, but it has no genetic contribution and so is not heritable.\nHeritability does not necessarily give any information about how easy or difficult it is to change a trait. For example, hair color is a trait with high heritability, but it is very easy to change with dye.\n\nTabery (2009), Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (2023)"

    "text": "The 10 Replicated Findings of Behavioral Genetics\nMost of this information comes from Robert Plomin et al. (2016).1\n\n1- All psychological traits show significant and substantial genetic influence\nAll traits, including psychological traits, are heritable.This has led this to be described as the first ‘law’ of behavioral genetics (Turkheimer 2000). Traits in psychological domains have consistently shown significant genetic influence. (R. Plomin 2008). Polderman et al. (2015) systematically categorized and meta-analyzed all prior twin studies. When investigating cognitive, psychiatric, and neurological traits with enough data to have a provided heritability estimate, the heritability estimate for these traits average around a little less than fifty percent. Between cognitive traits, the lowest and highest heritabilities were 0.19 and 0.67. Between neurological traits, the lowest and highest heritabilities were 0.31 to 0.51. Between psychiatric traits, the lowest and highest heritabilities were 0.32 and 0.74.\nThe research for genetic attribution has primarily relied on the twin design that compares resemblance of identical and fraternal twins and the adoption design that compares resemblance of relatives separated by adoption. Although the twin and adoption designs have separately been criticized (R. Plomin 2008), these two designs generally converge on the same conclusion, despite making very different assumptions, which adds strength to these conclusions.\nGenome-wide Complex Trait Analysis (Yang et al. 2011). uses hundreds of thousands of DNA differences across the genome to estimate chance genetic similarity for each pair of individuals in a large sample of conventionally unrelated individuals and to relate this chance genetic similarity to phenotypic similarity. GCTA underestimates genetic influence for several reasons and requires samples of several thousand individuals in order to pick up the tiny signal of chance genetic similarity from the noise of DNA differences across the genome (Vinkhuyzen et al. 2013). Nonetheless, GCTA has consistently yielded evidence for significant genetic influence for\n\ncognitive abilities (Benyamin et al. 2013; Davies et al. 2015; St. Pourcain et al. 2014)\npsychopathology (L. Davis et al. 2013; Gaugler et al. 2014; Klei et al. 2012; Lubke et al. 2012, 2013; Mcgue et al. 2013; Ripke et al. 2013; Wray et al. 2014)\npersonality (C. Rietveld et al. 2013; Verweij et al. 2012; Vinkhuyzen et al. 2012)\nsubstance use/drug dependence (Palmer et al. 2014; Vrieze et al. 2013)\n\nthus supporting the results of twin and adoption studies.\n“Significant and substantial genetic influence on individual differences in psychological traits is so widespread that we are unable to name an exception. The challenge now is to find any reliably measured behavioral trait for which genetic influence is not significantly different from zero in more than one adequately powered study.”\n\n\n2- No traits are 100% heritable\nNo traits are 100% heritable (Plomin 1989; Turkheimer 2000). Although heritability estimates are significantly greater than 0%, they are also significantly less than 100%. While there are virtually no traits that are 100 percent heritable, we must note that behavioral traits are less reliably measured than physical traits such as height and error of measurement contributes to non-heritable variance.\n\n\n3- Heritability is caused by many genes of small effect\nA typical human behavioral trait is associated with very many genetic variants, each of which accounts for a very small percentage of the behavioral variability. This has been called the fourth law of behavioral genetics (Chabris et al. 2015). GCTA also provides evidence for the highly polygenic nature of quantitative traits and qualitative disorders because it shows that SNPs on each chromosome contribute cumulatively to the heritability estimated by GCTA (Yang et al. 2013), The strongest evidence comes from a method called genome-wide association (GWA), which has been widely used in attempts to identify specific DNA associations with quantitative traits and qualitative disorders (Manolio et al. 2009).\nGWA has been successful in detecting SNP associations for many traits and disorders (Visscher et al. 2012), but it was a shock to discover that the largest effect sizes are extremely small (Gratten et al. 2014). In other words, the largest effect sizes detected by GWA are extremely small for both disorders and traits. This finding has been noted by many others, and specifically in relation to psychological traits (e.g. Gratten et al. 2014; Robert Plomin and Deary 2014).\nAlthough the power of GWA is limited to detect such minuscule effects even with samples in the tens or hundreds of thousands, these studies have tremendous power to detect larger effects (Robinson, Wray, and Visscher 2014). For example, a GWA study of 20,000 individuals has 99.9% power to detect an association with an effect size that accounts for 1% of the variance (i.e., a correlation of 0.10). This suggests that no such associations exist with effect sizes larger than 1% in the population. Some extremely rare mutations have large effects on individuals, but because they are rare their effect on the population is small. If the largest effects are so small, the smallest effects are likely to be infinitesimal, which implies that heritability is caused by many genes of small effect (Chabris et al. 2015; Robert Plomin and Simpson 2013).\n\n\n4- Phenotypic correlations between psychological traits show significant and substantial genetic mediation\nMuch psychological research is about the relationship between traits. When genetically informed designs are used for these psychological correlations, research consistently points to a finding with far-reaching implications: Phenotypic covariance between traits is significantly and substantially caused by genetic covariance, not just environmentally driven covariance. Multivariate genetic analysis estimates the extent to which genetic and environmental influences contribute to the phenotypic covariance between traits by comparing for example the cross-trait cross-twin correlations for MZ and same-sex DZ twins (i.e., correlating one twin’s X with the co-twin’s Y) (R. Plomin 2008). If the MZ cross-correlation is greater than the DZ cross-correlation, it suggests that genetic factors contribute to the phenotypic correlation between the traits, which is what we mean by the phrase genetic mediation.\nCognitive abilities have been studied most systematically from a multivariate genetic perspective. This research consistently shows that the phenotypic correlations among cognitive abilities are mediated significantly and substantially by genetic factors, called generalist genes (Robert Plomin and Kovas 2005).\n\nFor example, (O. Davis, Haworth, and Plomin 2009) a multivariate genetic analysis of intelligence, reading, mathematics and language in nearly 5000 12-year-old twins found that genetic factors consistently accounted for over half of the phenotypic correlations. These findings have received support from multivariate GCTA (Trzaskowski et al. 2013).\n\nMore than one hundred twin studies have addressed the key question of comorbidity in psychopathology and this body of research also consistently finds substantial genetic overlap between common disorders (Cerda et al. 2009; K. Kendler et al. 2003) in children (Rhee, Lahey, and Waldman 2014) and in adults (K. Kendler et al. 2010).\n\nFor example, a review of 23 twin studies and 12 family studies confirms that anxiety and depression are correlated entirely for genetic reasons (Middeldorp et al. 2005). These twin study findings of genetic overlap among disorders have received support from multivariate GCTA studies (Lee et al. 2013) and from GWA studies (Consortium et al. 2013).\nFor example, a recent review of molecular genetic studies of schizophrenia concluded: “There is evidence for shared genetic risk between schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorders, intellectual disability and attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder” (Kavanagh et al. 2014).\n\nThese results convey an important implication: the genetic structure of psychopathology does not map neatly on current diagnostic classifications (Doherty and Owen 2014). Moreover, correlations between personality dimensions and psychopathological diagnoses are also mediated genetically, most notably between neuroticism and depression (K. Kendler et al. 2006).\nThis finding goes far beyond these well-known examples of genetic contributions to correlations in the domains of cognitive abilities and psychopathology. Whenever a phenotypic correlation is found between two behavioral traits, the genetic contribution to the phenotypic correlation is significant and substantial, with the usual caveat of adequate power, which is especially severe for low phenotypic correlations. As one of many such examples of new but as yet unreplicated findings of this type, genes accounted for more than 70% of the phenotypic correlations of about 0.30 between attitudes toward exercise and exercise behavior, meaning that many of the same genes affect the two traits (Huppertz et al. 2013).\nThis finding extends even further, to the phenotypic correlations between behavior and other variables that are not ostensibly measures of behavior. One of our other findings is of this type: phenotypic correlations between behavioral measures and environmental measures (Finding 8).\n\n\n5- The heritability of intelligence increases throughout development\nThe heritability of intelligence increases throughout development. Although it would be reasonable to expect that experiences accumulate in their effect as time goes by, which some developmental theories propose, (e.g., Baltes, Reese, and Lipsitt 1980) the heritability of intelligence has consistently over three decades’ research been found to increase linearly throughout the life course in longitudinal as well as cross-sectional analyses and in adoption as well as twin studies (McGue et al. 1993; R. Plomin 1986; Robert Plomin and Deary 2014). Haworth, Dale, and Plomin (2009)2 showed that the heritability of intelligence linearly increases from childhood to adulthood. Polderman et al. (2015) compiled all previous twin studies and found that the heritability of intelligence increases with age and the shared environmental effect decreases with age. A meta-analysis of results from longitudinal twin and adoption studies also found increases in heritability from infancy through adolescence (Briley and Tucker-Drob 2013).\nIncreasing heritability for intelligence is interesting because other domains such as personality do not show systematic changes in heritability during development (Turkheimer, Pettersson, and Horn 2013); reasons for this difference in results are not known. However, a meta-analysis of seven behavioral domains other than intelligence found significant increases in heritability for externalizing and internalizing behavior problems and social attitudes during adolescence and young adulthood (Bergen, Gardner, and Kendler 2007).\n\n\n6- Age-to-age stability is mainly due to genetics\nLongitudinal genetic studies consistently show that phenotypic correlations from age to age are largely due to genetic stability. In other words, genetic effects contribute to continuity (the same genes affect the trait across age), whereas age-to-age change is primarily the provenance of environmental factors (R. Plomin 1986). Longitudinal genetic analysis is a variant on multivariate genetic analysis of the phenotypic covariance across time for the ‘same’ trait. Such research has shown that phenotypic stability from age to age is mainly due to genetics for personality, psychopathology and intelligence, domains for which the most longitudinal genetic data are available.\n\nFor personality, the first report of a longitudinal genetic analysis over an age span of a decade concluded that 80% of the phenotypic stability was mediated genetically (McGue, Bacon, and Lykken 1993), which has been confirmed in recent meta-analyses (Briley and Tucker-Drob 2014; Turkheimer, Pettersson, and Horn 2013).\nFor psychopathology, fewer longitudinal genetic studies are available but results are similar for diverse traits related to psychopathology such as borderline personality disorder (Bornovalova et al. 2009); antisocial personality disorder (S. A. Burt et al. 2007); aggression (beijsterveldt et al. 2003); attention problems (M. J. H. Rietveld et al. 2004); withdrawn behavior (Hoekstra et al. 2008); anxiety and depression (K. S. Kendler, Gardner, and PA 2008); general internalizing and externalizing problems (Bartels et al. 2004).\nFor intelligence, similar results have been reported in Tucker-Drob and Briley (2014). This finding creates an apparent paradox: How can the heritability of intelligence increase so substantially throughout development if genetic effects are stable? 3 Increasing heritability despite genetic stability implies some contribution from what has been called genetic amplification (Robert Plomin and DeFries 1985a). In other words, genetic nudges early in development are magnified as time goes by, increasing heritability, but the same genetic propensities continue to affect behavior throughout the life course. This amplification model has recently been supported in a (Briley and Tucker-Drob 2013). Genotype-environment correlation seems the most likely explanation in which small genetic differences are amplified as children select, modify and create environments correlated with their genetic propensities (Scarr and McCartney 1983). 4\n\n\n\n7- Most measures of the ‘environment’ show significant genetic influence\nAlthough it might seem a peculiar thing to do, measures of the environment widely used in psychological science – such as parenting, social support, and life events – can be treated as dependent measures in genetic analyses. If they are truly measures of the environment they should not show genetic influence.5 However, significant genetic influence was found for objective quantifications of environments. 6\nIn 1991, a review of the first 18 studies using environmental measures as dependent measures in genetically sensitive designs showed evidence for genetic influence for these measures of the environment (Robert Plomin and Bergeman 1991). Since 1991, more than 150 papers using environmental measures in genetically sensitive designs have been published, consistently showing significant genetic influence on environmental measures, extending the findings from family environments to neighborhood, school, and work environments. A review of 55 independent genetic studies found an average heritability of 0.27 across 35 diverse environmental measures (K. Kendler and Baker 2007) Meta-analyses of parenting, the most frequently studied domain, show genetic influence that is driven by child characteristics (Avinun and Knafo-Noam 2013) as well as by parent characteristics (Klahr and Burt 2013). 7 8\nGCTA has begun to replicate these findings from twin studies. For example, GCTA has shown significant genetic influence on stressful life events (Power et al. 2012) and on variables often used as environmental measures in epidemiological studies such as years of schooling (C. Rietveld et al. 2013). GCTA can also circumvent a limitation of twin studies when the twins are children. Such twin studies are limited to investigating within-family (twin-specific) experiences, whereas many important environmental factors such as SES are the same for two children in a family. However, GCTA can assess genetic influence on family environments such as SES that differ between families not within families. GCTA has shown genetic influence on family SES (Trzaskowski et al. 2014) and an index of social deprivation (Marioni et al. 2014).\n\n\n8- Most measures of the ‘environment’ show significant genetic influence\nIf genetic factors affect environmental measures as well as behavioral measures, it is reasonable to ask the extent to which associations between environmental measures and behavioral measures are mediated genetically. For example, rather than assuming that correlations between parenting and children’s behavior are caused by the environmental effect of parenting on children’s behavior, it is important to consider the possibility that the correlation is in part due to genetic factors that influence both parenting and children’s behavior. Individual differences in parenting might reflect genetically driven differences in children’s behavior or differences in parenting might be due to genetically driven propensities of parents that are inherited directly by their children.\nIn 1985, using a parent-offspring adoption design, evidence emerged for genetic mediation that accounted on average for about half of the correlations between measures of home environment and infants’ development (Robert Plomin, Loehlin, and DeFries 1985). For example, at age 2, the correlation between the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) and Bayley Mental Development Index was 0.44 in non adoptive families, in which parents share nature as well as nurture with their offspring, as compared to 0.29 in adoptive families in which parents and offspring are genetically unrelated (Robert Plomin and DeFries 1985b).\nIn twin studies, multivariate genetic analysis can be used to disentangle genetic and environmental effects from correlations between environmental measures and behavioral measures. Pike et al. (1996), found that two-thirds of the correlation between maternal negativity and adolescent children’s antisocial behavior could be attributed to genetic factors. More than a hundred studies have reported similar results, extending the findings to cross-lagged longitudinal analyses (S. Burt, McGue, and Krueger, n.d.; Neiderhiser et al. 1999) and to new designs such as the children-of-twins design (Knopik et al. 2006; Mcadams et al. 2014) and the combined parents-of-twins and extended children-of-twins design (Narusyte et al. 2008).\nGCTA is beginning to provide additional support for this finding. For example, bivariate GCTA has shown significant genetic mediation between family SES and children’s intelligence (Trzaskowski et al. 2014) and educational performance (Krapohl and Plomin 2015). Showing genetic influence on family SES and its association with children’s intelligence and educational performance is less surprising than it might at first seem because family SES indexes parental education which also correlates substantially with parental intelligence.It is important to disentangle genetic and environmental influences on correlations between environmental and behavioral measures for three reasons.\n\nFirst, if these correlations are mediated genetically, interpretations that assume environmental causation are wrong, which has important implications for intervention.\nSecond, genetically sensitive designs can identify causal effects of the environment free of genetic confound (Marceau et al. 2014).\nThird, genetic mediation of the association between environmental measures and behavioral traits is not just a nuisance that needs to be controlled. It suggests a general way of thinking about how genotypes develop into phenotypes, from a passive model of imposed environments to an active model of shaped experiences in which we select, modify and create experiences in part based on our genetic propensities.\n\n\n\n9- Most environmental effects aren’t shared by children raised in the same family\nIt is reasonable to think that growing up in the same family makes brothers and sisters similar psychologically, which is what developmental theorists from Freud onwards assumed. However, for most behavioral dimensions and disorders, it is genetics that accounts for similarity among siblings. Although environmental effects have a major impact, the salient environmental influences do not make siblings growing up in the same family similar. The message is not that family experiences are unimportant but rather that the relevant experiences are specific to each child in the family. This finding was ignored when it was first noted (Loehlin and Nichols 1976) and controversial when it was first highlighted Robert Plomin and Daniels (1987b), but it is now widely accepted because it has consistently replicated (Robert Plomin 2011) This finding, that the effect of being raised in the same family is smaller than the effect of the genes is so consistent, it is described as the second law of behavioral genetics (Turkheimer 2000).\nThe acceptance is so complete that the focus now is on finding any shared environmental influence (Buchanan et al. 2009), for example,\n\npersonality (e.g., Matteson, Mcgue, and Iacono 2013)\nchildhood psychopathology (S. A. Burt 2009, 2013)\nantisocial behavior in adolescence (Rhee and Waldman 2002) 9\nacademic achievement (Kovas et al. 2007) 10\nintelligence (Briley and Tucker-Drob 2013; Haworth, Dale, and Plomin 2009) 11\n\nProgress in identifying specific sources of nonshared environmental effects has been slow (Turkheimer and Waldron 2000), although the MZ differences design is proving useful in detecting some nonshared effects controlling for genetic confounding (Robert Plomin 2011). It seems likely that nonshared environmental effects are due to many experiences of small effect, analogous to Finding 3 (‘heritability is caused by many genes of small effect’). That is, rather than asking whether a monolithic factor like parental control is primarily responsible for nonshared effects, it might be necessary to consider many seemingly inconsequential experiences that are tipping points in children’s lives. The ‘gloomy prospect’ is that these could be idiosyncratic stochastic experiences – chance (Robert Plomin and Daniels 1987a).\n\n\n10- Abnormal is normal\nA fundamental question about common psychological disorders is the extent to which genetic and environmental effects on disorders are merely the quantitative extremes of the same genetic and environmental factors that affect the rest of the distribution. Or are common disorders qualitatively different from the normal range of behavior? 12\nThe first quantitative genetic method is DeFries-Fulker (DF) extremes analysis, which assesses genetic links between the extremes and the normal range of variation by bringing together disorders and dimensions (DeFries and Fulker 1985, 1988). DF extremes analysis assesses the extent to which the quantitative scores of identical and fraternal twin partners (cotwins) of selected index cases (probands) regress differentially to the population mean. 13 This comparison of identical and fraternal cotwin means yields an estimate of group heritability, an index of the extent to which the extreme scores of probands is due to genetic influences, and thereby provides a test of the hypothesis that the etiology of extreme scores differs from that of variation within the normal range. Consequently, finding significant group heritability implies that there are genetic links between the disorder, however assessed, and the quantitative trait. That is, if the measure of extremes (or a diagnosis) were not linked genetically to the quantitative trait, group heritability would be zero. DF extremes analysis was developed to assess reading disability in the context of reading ability (DeFries and Fulker 1988). Research using the method has consistently shown that group heritabilities are substantial for cognitive disability such as language, mathematical and general learning disability, as well as reading disability (Robert Plomin and Kovas 2005). An interesting exception involves severe intellectual disability (IQ &lt; 70), which DF extremes analysis suggests is etiologically distinct from the normal distribution of intelligence (Reichenberg et al. 2016).\nAnother quantitative genetic technique, called liability-threshold model-fitting, relies on dichotomous data such as diagnoses. It assumes that liability is distributed normally but that the disorder occurs only when a certain threshold of liability is exceeded. Liability-threshold model-fitting estimates heritability of liability but this is not the heritability of the disorder as assessed quantitatively – it is the heritability of a hypothetical construct of continuous liability derived from dichotomous data. Nonetheless, if all the assumptions of the liability-threshold model are correct for a particular disorder, it will yield results similar to the DF extremes analysis to the extent that the quantitative dimension assessed underlies the qualitative disorder. For cognitive disabilities and abilities, liability-threshold analyses yield estimates of heritability similar to DF extremes analysis (Robert Plomin and Kovas 2005). Similar results from DF extremes analysis and liability-threshold model-fitting have been found for psychopathology (Charney et al. 2013; for recent examples, see Zavos et al. 2014). In this way, these two quantitative genetic methods – DeFries-Fulker extremes analysis and liability-threshold model-fitting – lead to the conclusion that common disorders represent the extremes of the same genetic influences responsible for heritability throughout the distribution.\nDNA research can address this issue directly: Genes associated with disorders are expected to be associated with dimensions and vice versa. Although evidence for replicable genetic associations is just emerging for complex traits, the data are consistent with this prediction (Robert Plomin, Haworth, and Davis 2009). For example, a polygenic score derived from a GWA of ADHD cases and control significantly predicted an ADHD trait measure in the general population (Groen-Blokhuis et al. 2014; Martin et al. 2014) and vice versa (Stergiakouli et al. 2015).\nAlthough the individual effects of genetic associations found in GCTA are tiny, their effects can be aggregated in ‘polygenic’ scores, like summing items on a test (Wray et al. 2014). These polygenic scores are distributed normally, as Fisher anticipated (Fisher 1919; Robert Plomin, Haworth, and Davis 2009). The normal distribution of polygenic scores suggests that what we call disorders are the quantitative extreme of the same genetic factors that affect the rest of the distribution. Stated more provocatively, there are no common disorders, just quantitative traits – the abnormal is normal. This finding supports the recently adopted NIMH Research Domain Criteria strategy that focuses on dimensional models of psychopathology rather than diagnostic categories (Insel et al. 2010)14.\n\n\n\n\nAvinun, Reut, and Ariel Knafo-Noam. 2013. “Parenting as a Reaction Evoked by Children’s Genotype: A Meta-Analysis of Children-as-Twins Studies.” Personality and Social Psychology Review : An Official Journal of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc 18 (August). https://doi.org/10.1177/1088868313498308.\n\n\nBaltes, P B, H W Reese, and L P Lipsitt. 1980. “Life-Span Developmental Psychology.” Annual Review of Psychology 31 (1): 65–110. https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.ps.31.020180.000433.\n\n\nBartels, Meike, E Oord, James Hudziak, M Rietveld, Toos van beijsterveldt, and Dorret Boomsma. 2004. “Genetic and Environmental Mechanisms Underlying Stability and Change in Problem Behaviors at Ages 3, 7, 10, and 12.” Developmental Psychology 40 (October): 852–67. https://doi.org/10.1037/0012-1649.40.5.852.\n\n\nbeijsterveldt, Toos van, Meike Bartels, James Hudziak, and Dorret Boomsma. 2003. “Causes of Stability of Aggression from Early Childhood to Adolescence: A Longitudinal Genetic Analysis in Dutch Twins.” Behavior Genetics 33 (October): 591–605. https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1025735002864.\n\n\nBenyamin, Beben, B.

Genotype-environment correlation also predicts the next finding about genetic influence on ostensible measures of the environment.↩︎\n How can measures of the environment show genetic influence? The reason is that such measures do not assess the environment ‘out there’ independent of the person. As noted above, we select, modify and create environments correlated with our genetic behavioral propensities such as personality and psychopathology (McAdams et al., 2013).↩︎\n This includes videotape observations of parenting as well as self-report measures of parenting, social support, and life events.↩︎\n Some exceptions have emerged. Not surprisingly, when life events are separated into uncontrollable events (e.g., death of a spouse) and controllable life events (e.g., financial problems), the former show nonsignificant genetic influence.↩︎\n As a reminder that all behavioral genetic results can differ in different cultures, a comparison of parenting in Japan and Sweden found that parenting in Japan showed more genetic influence than in Sweden, which is consistent with the view that parenting is more child centered in Japan than in the West (Shikishima et al., 2012).↩︎\n shared environment accounts for about 15% of the total phenotypic variance; however, even here nonshared environment accounts for more of the variance, about 40% in meta-analyses, although these estimates include variance due to error of measurement↩︎\n This trait consistently shows some shared environmental influence, presumably due to the effect of schools, although the effect is surprisingly modest in its magnitude (about 15% for English and 10% for Mathematics) given that this result is based on siblings growing up in the same family and being taught in the same school (Kovas et al. 2007). Polderman et al. (2015) reports the shared environmental influence to be around 0.27.↩︎\n An interesting developmental exception is that shared environmental influence is found for intelligence up until adolescence and then diminishes as adolescents begin to make their own way in the world, as shown in meta-analyses (Briley and Tucker-Drob 2013; Haworth, Dale, and Plomin 2009).↩︎\n There are thousands of rare single-gene disorders such as phenylketonuria (PKU), which causes intellectual disability and has a frequency of about 1 in 10,000. This is the way we often think about disorders – as qualitatively different from the normal range of behavior. However, disorders studied by psychologists are much more common, including learning disabilities and psychopathology such as schizophrenia, autism, and hyperactivity.↩︎\n rather than assessing the genetic etiology of a disorder dichotomously using identical and fraternal twin concordance rates, In other words, to the extent that genetic influences are responsible for the difference between the probands and the rest of the population, cotwins should be more similar to the probands for identical twins than for fraternal twins.↩︎\n There is also a less obvious implication. Polygenic scores are typically referred to as polygenic risk scores because their constituent associations were derived from case-control studies comparing a group of individuals diagnosed with a disorder and controls. However, this ‘risk’ label misses the point that because these polygenic scores are distributed normally their distribution has a positive end as well as a negative end. This opens up opportunities for considering positive genetics – how children flourish rather than flounder and about resilience rather than vulnerability (Robert Plomin, Haworth, and Davis 2009).↩︎"

Every behavioral geneticist believes that each individual is the product of the totality of their genes being expressed in the totality of their environment. (A. Jensen 2012, 50) Whether or not the influences of genetics and environments can be disentangled is a matter of empirics. (Wright et al. 2015)\nIf all humans were genotypically identical or if all humans lived in perfectly similar environments, there would be no need for heritability estimates since we could attribute all variation to environmental or genetic factors respectively. Since people with different genes live in different environments, we then have an interplay between the two that produce phenotypic variation. Heritability estimates are the tools we can use to measure an observed variation of phenotype to attribute the respective portion to genetic and environmental influence."

    "text": "1.6 BUT genetic contribution for ‘g’ or cognitive ability is non-additive\nThere are two ways to determine if the genetic influence of traits are non-additive. Through twin and family estimations and molecular biological estimates- each method having unique advantages. (Robert Plomin and Von Stumm 2018)\nWith twin and family data, we have discovered that genetic effects on g seem to be largely additive. (Robert Plomin 1999) Large twin studies like Haworth et al. (2009) and Robert Plomin and Thompson (2007) found that all genetic influence was additive for the entire distribution of intelligence. (see also Robert Plomin and Deary 2014) Since assortative mating naturally increases additivity, estimates after controlling for this find that the majority of the genetic effect to be additive using twin and family data. (Chipuer, Rovine, and Plomin 1990; Vinkhuyzen et al. 2012)\nA newer way to measure the genetic variance of a trait that relies on different methodological assumptions than twin and family studies is through molecular biological estimates. (Maciej Trzaskowski et al. 2013) Since complex traits are often extremely polygenic, it is unlikely for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to fully capture the effect of genetic additive influence, thus, it is understood that these analyses provide a lower bound for measuring the variance of additive genetic influence on traits. (Li et al. 2019) By using genome-wide complex trait analyses (GCTA), however, we can boost genomic coverage and thus increase the estimate for genetic variance. (Yang, Manolio, et al. 2011; William David Hill et al. 2019) The significance of this method is that it can estimate the net effect of genetic influence using DNA of unrelated individuals rather than relying on familial resemblance in groups of special family members such as monozygotic and dizygotic twins who differ in genetic relatedness. (Robert Plomin and Deary 2014) Additionally, GCTA is limited to detecting the additive effects of SNPs; it cannot detect gene–gene or gene–environment interaction. (Yang, Lee, et al. 2011) An earlier GCTA from (M. Trzaskowski et al. 2014) found DNA-estimated heritabilities increased from 0.26 at age 7 to 0.45 at age 12- roughly matching twin data. W. David Hill et al. (2018), a newer study, finds that over 50 percent of differences in intelligence can be explained by genetic effects when a larger number of rare SNPs are included- which matches both current and historical heritability estimates with twin and family models on average.

Therefore, heritability claims are not generalizable.\nFirst, no one denies that heritability is a population level statistic:\n\n“Heritability is not a constant that holds for all groups or in all environments.” (Rushton and Jensen 2005)\n“Heritability is a population statistic and the heritability of intelligence may be expected to vary in different populations”; (Lynn and Harvey 2008)\n“The heritability of a trait may change when the conditions producing variation change” (Herrnstein and Murray 2010).\n\nThough heritability is a population level statistic, this doesn’t mean we should be surprised to see estimates that can be generalized under the right conditions. “[W]henever a value is stated for the heritability of a given character it must be understood to refer to a particular population under particular conditions. Values found in other populations under other circumstances will be more or less the same according to whether the structure of the population and the environmental conditions are more or less alike”. (Falconer 1996) The question of generalizing [genetic variability] to other samples and other times can only be answered empirically (the evidence with respect to cognitive abilities suggests considerable generalizability). (Robert Plomin and DeFries 1976, 11)\n“Although heritability could differ in different cultures, moderate heritability of g has been found, not only in twin studies in North American and western European countries, but also in Moscow, former East Germany, rural India, urban India, and Japan” (R. Plomin 2002)1. Pesta et al. (2020) found that White, Black, and Hispanic heritabilities were consistently moderate to high, and that these heritabilities did not differ across groups in the United States.\nTo radically say that heritability estimates are not at all generalizable even across state lines (Moore 2002, 47), would be akin to saying that teaching interventions that work in one state has no generalizability to another.\nWhile some critics have cited the non-experimental nature of human behavioral genetics as a serious methodological deficiency (Michel and Moore 1995, 209), this ironically may actually work in its favor in the context of real world natural experiments versus laboratory experimentation. Not dealing with artificial, laboratory conditions but with real-life situations, its conclusions obtained on given samples are easier to extrapolate to other similar populations (see Winkler and Murphy 1973). Human behavioral genetic researchers have the mixed blessing of working with naturally occurring genetic and environmental variation. The cost is a loss of experimental control; the benefit is an increased likelihood that the result of the research will generalize (Robert Plomin, DeFries, and Fulker 1988, 231; R. Plomin 1986, 99; Robert Plomin and Hershberger 1991, 33)"

    "text": "1.9 BUT the rising heritability of intelligence with age is due to GxE interaction\nSee here\nDeary et al. (2012) reported a rather strong genetic correlation (0.62) between IQ measured at age 11 and IQ measured at age 65-79 in a large scottish sample (N=1,940). In another longitudinal sample, Brant et al. (2009) p. 401-402 report positive genetic correlations between IQs measured at age 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 12, 16, that tend to increase with age, “signifying that the same genetic effects are evident from infancy to late adolescence, but that these influences increase in importance across development”. Lyons et al. (2009) show a phenotypic correlation for AFQT, a highly g-loaded test, measured at age 20 (N=7,232) and 55 (N=1,237), at about 0.74, for which the genetic correlation was 1.0. The fact that Lyons et al. (2009) found no new genetic influences over the adult development is interesting. Brant et al. (2013) found that the genetic influence during the cognitive development comes both from previous, existing genetic influences and new influences; the authors also report a lower heritability for high-IQ people, and a higher heritability for lower-IQ people (N=11,000). Brant, nevertheless, seems to reject a commonly invoked theory for explaining the rise in heritability, namely, the active GxE correlational model :\n\nThe most prominent theory of developmental increases in the heritability of IQ posits that across development, individuals gain more scope to shape their own environments on the basis of their genetic propensities (active gene-environment correlation), which causes an increase in genetic influence over time (Haworth et al., 2010; Plomin, DeFries, & Loehlin, 1977). Our results challenge this explanation, as they show a later increase in heritability for individuals of higher IQ. To explain our results in the context of active gene-environment correlations, one would need to posit, counterintuitively, that higher-IQ individuals seek out environments concordant with their genetic propensities later in development than do lower-IQ individuals.\n\nThe plausibility of their hypothesis is supported by the fact that IQ differences certainly reflect differences in mental age (A. R. Jensen 1980, 559–62; 1999, 370–71). The authors are still open to the possibility of the amplification model which is, at present, perhaps the most likely and tenable hypothesis. Van Soelen et al. (2011) confirmed the amplification model in a pediatric longitudinal sample, consistent with Hoekstra, Bartels, and Boomsma (2007) p. 112 analysis, in which no clear pattern of GxE interaction has been found and in which they show a correlation between verbal and nonverbal abilities that is entirely explained by genetic effects, with stability in nonverbal ability attributed completely to genetic influences between age 5 and 18 (p. 105-109). Subsequently, Leeuwen, Berg, and Boomsma (2008) p. 78, 84-85, 86-87 also report weak effect of GxE interaction (due to nonshared environmental influences), in line with A. Jensen (2012) p. 173-174, and no evidence for cultural transmission between generations, as was also the case in most previous studies. In their best fitting model, assuming phenotypic assortment (i.e., mating based on observable characteristics such as intelligence), as opposed to the model assuming social homogamy (i.e., mating based on environmental resemblance only because spouses of same IQ level meet each other given that people with the same IQ level live in the same social environment), genetic variation contributes 58% to the variation in IQ among children and adults, with the remaining 42% accounted for by unique, nonshared environmental variation. Also, Leeuwen, Berg, and Boomsma (2008) found no evidence of cultural transmission from parents to children, consistent with previous findings (Robert Plomin et al. 1997). Reminding this is essential because under the GxE correlational model, as is the case in Dickens & Flynn, it is assumed that parents transmit no only their genes but also their environment.\nMore recently, Briley and Tucker-Drob (2013) meta-analysis demonstrates that new genetic influences (innovation; e.g., novel biological changes such as hormonal changes associated with puberty, or environmental changes such as transition from the home to grade school) are likely to explain the increase in heritability at the very early stage of development, but beginning at age 8, genetic amplification becomes predominant, and the effect of new genetic influences drops to zero; the widening of the shaded area (i.e., standard error) with regard to amplification suggests that this parameter is not estimated with much precision, but the authors maintain that their alternative models show the very same phenomenon but more precisely (Figures S3 & S4). In any case, this does not square well with the Dickens-Flynn hypothesis. And thus the fact that Briley and Tucker-Drob (2013) cited Dickens and Flynn (2001) as an illustration of the evidence in favor of the amplification model is a curious non-sequitur.\nMuch (to all) of the information above is scraped from Hu (2013)."

    "text": "1.10 BUT something about generalist genes\nhttps://analyseeconomique.wordpress.com/2013/07/31/the-genetics-of-intelligence/\nAll this leads us to the generalist genes hypothesis (Kovas & Plomin, 2006a, 2006b), advanced by Robert Plomin, which consists in that the same genes that influence, say, school achievement, will also account for IQ test scores, or a cognitive area (math) correlated with another cognitive area (verbal) due to the same genetic influences. In this way, the correlation between these two variables is due to genetic effects. The two key concepts to understand the theory are pleiotropy (a single gene affecting several traits) and polygenicity (each trait is affected by a multitude of genes), the latter reinforcing the former. The theory received a considerable support from numerous studies on very large sample size (Plomin & Kovas, 2005; Plomin et al., 2007; Haworth et al., 2009; Docherty et al., 2010; Davis et al. (2009b); Calvin et al., 2012; Chow et al., 2013; Trzaskowski et al., 2013b, who used GCTA method). With regard to disability, which also displays non-trivial genetic correlations between language, reading and mathematics disabilities, Plomin et al. (2007) write :\nA common reaction to this conclusion about generalist genes is disbelief because it goes against the common observation that specific disabilities exist. That is, some children with reading problems have no problem with mathematics and vice versa. If genes are generalists, why do specific disabilities occur? There are three reasons. First, genes are also specialists – genetic correlations are not 1.0. Second, nonshared environments are largely specialists (Plomin & Kovas, in press-b). Third, there is less specificity than it might seem. Even though reading and mathematics correlate phenotypically 0.65 in TEDS, some children with reading problems have no problems with mathematics and vice versa. However, this so-called double dissociation is to be expected on statistical grounds alone and has no bearing on the extent to which different causal processes affect reading and mathematics. A related issue concerning the acceptance of these findings is that, although genetic correlations between learning abilities are greater than their phenotypic correlations, we cannot see genetic correlations in the population in the way that we can see phenotypic associations and dissociations.\nPosthuma (2003) and Deary (2006) propose a review of studies showing genetic correlation between g and brain volume, g and cognitive processing (reaction time, inspection time), and in particular the IQ-IT covariance (Luciano et al., 2005) as evidence that a pleiotropic gene model, unlike causal models, has been proved to be the best fitting model, in a large sample (N=2012), hence validating the genetic g hypothesis: “In short, there is no causal relationship between IT and IQ; instead, both processes/abilities are partially dependent on the same underlying cause, which analysis has shown to be genetic”. With regards with genetic g, there were strong genetic correlations between different cognitive domains (g factor, math, language, reading), usually higher than 0.50, sometimes approaching 1.0. From Deary et al. (2006, pp. 692-694) we read :"

    "text": "1.11 BUT missing heritability\nIf all the genes responsible for the heritability of traits could be identified, there would no longer be any need for twin or adoption studies. However, there is a great gap between genes identified so far in GWA studies and heritability estimates— the missing-heritability problem (Maher 2008). One of the most far-reaching results of GWA studies is to show that there are no genes of large effect size in the population, which means that the heritability of complex traits is probably due to many genes of small effect size, and this means that associations will be difficult to detect and replicate (Robert Plomin 2013). For example, the first GWA studies of general cognitive ability (Davies et al. 2011; O. S. Davis et al. 2010) were powered to detect associations that account for as little as .01 of the variance, but they came up empty-handed because the associations with the largest effect accounted for less than .005 of the variance. One of many possible reasons for the missing-heritability problem is that the common SNPs (i.e., SNPs for which the frequency of the less frequent allele is greater than .01) incorporated in commercially available DNA arrays miss the contribution of rare DNA variants (Cirulli and Goldstein 2010). Another possibility is that heritability has been overestimated by twin and adoption studies.\nWikipedia includes the following from their page on the missing heritability problem:\n\nThis resolution to the missing heritability problem was supported by the introduction of Genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA) in 2010, which demonstrated that trait similarity could be predicted by the genetic similarity of unrelated strangers on common SNPs treated additively, and for many traits the SNP heritability was indeed a substantial fraction of the overall heritability. The GCTA results were further supported by findings that a small percent of trait variance could be predicted in GWASes without any genome-wide statistically-significant hits by a linear model including all SNPs regardless of p-value; if there were no SNP contribution, this would be unlikely, but it would be what one expected from SNPs whose effects were very imprecisely estimated by a too-small sample. Combined with the upper bound on maximum effect sizes set by the GWASes up to then, this strongly implied that the highly polygenic theory was correct. Examples of complex traits where increasingly large-scale GWASes have yielded the initial hits and then increasing numbers of hits as sample sizes increased from n&lt;20k to n&gt;100k or n&gt;300k include height, educational attainment, and schizophrenia.\n\nMissing heritability is found in GWAS with big enough sample sizes (Kuchenbaecker 2022). Yengo et al. (2022) finds all relavent snips using 21% of the genome (non-hidden heritability SNPs). Compared with previous attemps:\n\nLango Allen et al. (2010) with n=183,727 find 180 SNPs totaling to 10 percent SNP heritability\nWood et al. (2014) with n=253,288 find 697 SNPs totaling to 20 percent SNP heritability\nYengo et al. (2022) with n=5,380,080 find 12,111 SNPs totaling to 45 percent SNP heritability\n\nwe have been able to find much of the heritability what has been supposedly missing from twin studies. In general, twin studies show that height is roughly 60-70 percent heritable meaning that if we were to expand the amount of genome we were searching on, we could potentially catch up to the estimated percent.\nGWAS on educational attainment shows this trend as well:\n\n\n\nOkbay et al. (2022)\n\n\nAs stated in Okbay et al. (2022), GWAS can currently predict roughly 12 percent of variation in educational attainment. Twin studies show that the heritability of educational attainment is roughly 50-60 percent, so as the sample size increases, perhaps this “missing heritability problem” will be resolved as well.\n\n\n\n\nBrant, Angela M, Brett C Haberstick, Robin P Corley, Sally J Wadsworth, John C DeFries, and John K Hewitt. 2009. “The Developmental Etiology of High IQ.” Behavior Genetics 39: 393–405.\n\n\nBrant, Angela M, Yuko Munakata, Dorret I Boomsma, John C DeFries, Claire MA Haworth, Matthew C Keller, Nicholas G Martin, et al. 2013. “The Nature and Nurture of High IQ: An Extended Sensitive Period for Intellectual Development.” Psychological Science 24 (8): 1487–95.\n\n\nBriley, Daniel, and Elliot Tucker-Drob. 2013. “Explaining the Increasing Heritability of Cognitive Ability Across Development a Meta-Analysis of Longitudinal Twin and Adoption Studies.” Psychological Science 24 (July). https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797613478618.\n\n\nCalvin, Catherine M, Ian J Deary, Dinand Webbink, Pauline Smith, Cres Fernandes, Sang Hong Lee, Michelle Luciano, and Peter M Visscher. 2012. “Multivariate Genetic Analyses of Cognition and Academic Achievement from Two Population Samples of 174,000 and 166,000 School Children.” Behavior Genetics 42: 699–710.\n\n\nCattell, Raymond B. 1960. “The Multiple Abstract Variance Analysis Equations and Solutions: For Nature-Nurture Research on Continuous Variables.” Psychological Review 67 (6): 353.\n\n\n———. 1963. “THE INTERACTION OF HEREDITARY AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES 1.” British Journal of Statistical Psychology 16 (2): 191–210.\n\n\n———. 1965. “Methodological and Conceptual Advances in Evaluating Hereditary and Environmental Influences and Their Interaction.” In Methods and Goals in Human Behavior Genetics, 95–139.

    "text": "1.5 BUT genetic contribution is non-additive. Genes and environment typically interact (in the statistical sense) to produce phenotypes.\nThe rarity of a significant statistical interaction between genes and environment has been established for several decades. Any significant amount of non-additive or GxE variation has largely been “purely a speculation about as yet untested environmental conditions” which even at the time most of the twin studies were criticized, “data concerning normal people moved around within common environmental situations show their norm of reaction for IQ to be in fact rather flat.” (Havender 1976, 609) Additionally, there is no conspiracy against interaction. If an interactive model could be shown to fit the data better than the traditional model, researchers would be quick to use it. (Robert Plomin 1990, 144). Polderman et al. (2015) surveyed every prior twin study and found that “for a majority of traits (69%), the observed statistics are consistent with a simple and parsimonious model where the observed variation is solely due to additive genetic variation. The data are inconsistent with a substantial influence …non-additive genetic variation.” Intelligence was not fully explained by an additive model. GxE and Non-additive genetic variance of complex traits tends to either be very low, or negligible. With dominant genetic effects lower than epistatic. (W. G.

    "text": "1.10 BUT something about generalist genes not existing\nThe generalist genes hypothesis (Kovas and Plomin 2006a, 2006b), advanced by Robert Plomin, posits that the same genes that influence, say, school achievement, will also account for IQ test scores, or a cognitive area (math) correlated with another cognitive area (verbal) due to the same genetic influences. In this way, the correlation between these two variables is due to genetic effects. The two key concepts to understand the theory are pleiotropy (a single gene affecting several traits) and polygenicity (each trait is affected by a multitude of genes), the latter reinforcing the former. The theory received a considerable support from numerous studies on very large sample size (Robert Plomin and Kovas 2005; Robert Plomin, Kovas, and Haworth 2007; Haworth, Dale, and Plomin 2009; Docherty et al. 2010; O. Davis, Haworth, and Plomin 2009; Calvin et al. 2012; Chow et al. 2013)\nGCTA also succeeds to replicate classical twin analyses. The genetic correlations between g and language, mathematics, reading, height, weight, reveal a great similarity between GCTA and twin estimates (Trzaskowski et al., 2013b).\nRobert Plomin and Kovas (2005) Tables 4 & 5 mention that high rG (Correlations between the latent genetic influences on each trait) also is prevalent for cognitive disability, as reading and math disability had an rG of 0.53. Within mathematics, ability and disability are also genetically correlated, with rG of 0.88. Within reading, ability and disability show rG between 0.70 and 0.90. Within language, ability and disability show rG between 0.60 and 0.90. Comorbidity, the correlation of one (dis)ability with another (dis)ability, is also evident. Bivariate heritability analyses through “DF extremes” (DeFries-Fulker) method yield large estimates between, say, reading disability and math ability. This indicates that one gene found for a certain disability will have a high chance to be associated with ability in some other cognitive domain. Deficits in processes are not genetically independent. Robert Plomin, Kovas, and Haworth (2007) write in this matter :\n\nA common reaction to this conclusion about generalist genes is disbelief because it goes against the common observation that specific disabilities exist. That is, some children with reading problems have no problem with mathematics and vice versa. If genes are generalists, why do specific disabilities occur? There are three reasons. First, genes are also specialists – genetic correlations are not 1.0. Second, nonshared environments are largely specialists (Plomin & Kovas, in press-b). Third, there is less specificity than it might seem. Even though reading and mathematics correlate phenotypically 0.65 in TEDS, some children with reading problems have no problems with mathematics and vice versa. However, this so-called double dissociation is to be expected on statistical grounds alone and has no bearing on the extent to which different causal processes affect reading and mathematics. A related issue concerning the acceptance of these findings is that, although genetic correlations between learning abilities are greater than their phenotypic correlations, we cannot see genetic correlations in the population in the way that we can see phenotypic associations and dissociations.\n\nPosthuma et al. (2003) and Deary, Spinath, and Bates (2006) propose a review of studies showing genetic correlation between g and brain volume, g and cognitive processing (reaction time, inspection time), and in particular the IQ-IT covariance (Luciano et al. 2005) as evidence that a pleiotropic gene model, unlike causal models, has been proved to be the best fitting model, in a large sample (N=2012), hence validating a genetic g hypothesis but not any of the proposed causal paths, either top-down or bottom-up : “In short, there is no causal relationship between IT and IQ; instead, both processes/abilities are partially dependent on the same underlying cause, which analysis has shown to be genetic”. Luciano et al. (2004) had previously demonstrated the existence of a higher-order genetic g among chronometric tests. g is not only confined to psychometric tests. The strong genetic correlations between different cognitive domains (g factor, math, language, reading), usually higher than 0.50, sometimes approaching 1.0, is suggestive of a genetic g.\nMuch (to all) of the information above is scraped from Hu (2013)."

What is taken to follow from zero heritability is only that genes are unimportant for explaining the existing phenotypic differences in the population in question. (Wray and Visscher 2008)1 It answers the question, “Do genetic differences explain why the number of fingers differ among humans?” Second, even if a trait is shared by all organisms in a given population, it can still be heritable. When expanding the population tested with more species, now the heritability estimate will answer, “Do genetic differences explain why the number of fingers differ among organisms”"

    "text": "2.2 BUT the heritability of wearing earrings in humans is very high\nConceptually, wearing earrings is a perfectly fine trait to measure heritability.2 Although a procedure outside of genetics, the disposition to wear earrings may very well be influenced by genes. Additionally, it is important to remember that heritability studies should take into account the population being studied (Wray and Visscher 2008). Block (1995) ironically explains the utility in this in his criticism of heritability. Since “only women wore earrings” historically, it would be more useful to measure men and women separately since both shared and nonshared environmental effects will give unequal effects. Furthermore, when looking within the sexes, earring use could reasonably be correlated with grandiosity- a trait that seems to be moderately heritable.(Luo and Cai 2018)"

To better illustrate why the bucket analogy would be problematic for comparison, if we assume that replacing Billy or Suzy with another Billy or Suzy would change a measure of the bucket- then we can absolutely quantify the respective variance to a population of buckets with the respective variance attributed to interchanging Billys and Suzys."

What matters, and matters only, is whether this increased environmental similarity of MZ twins also causes the twins to be increasingly similar phenotypically. If there is a way to show that the greater environmental similarity of MZ twins has no impact on the phenotype, then its presence would be no obstacle to obtaining the heritability estimates used by twin studies. The equal environment assumption only assumes that monozygotic twins do not have phenotype-influencing trait-relevant environments that are more similar than those of an average pair of dizygotic siblings.\nWhether environmental influence is the causal factor for higher concordance of phenotype among monozygotic twins is purely an empirical question since the default, parsimonious model for twin studies shows that higher concordance among monozygotic twins is solely due to additive genetic variation.

    "text": "2.4 BUT twin studies erroneously assume that monozygotic twins are not treated more similarly than dizygotic twins\nThe equal environments assumption has been tested several times- virtually all of them finding no violation of the assumption. Supplementary materials from Barnes et al. (2014) reviews the literature of the equal environments assumption and supports it. Felson (2014) comprehensively reviewed the evidence on the equal environments assumption, and did its own analysis with the most comprehensive set of controls to date. Correcting for violations adjusted heritability figures downwards only very modestly; heritability figures, at most, go down by about 10%. It is important to consider that this line of research is often merely correlational: Correcting twin class correlations for “environmental” similarity should be done with caution because such corrections may be inadvertently committing the sociologist’s fallacy. The entire goal is to root out causality. Genetic similarity may cause “environmental” similarity rather than the other way around.\nTo rigorously test the classical twin method for genetic causality, we must ask why identical twins would have more similar environments than fraternal twins if not for reasons of genotype creating environment. This leaves us with essentially three options:\n\n(Hypothesis 1) In terms of physical appearance, identical twins look more similar to each other than do fraternal twins, the phenotypic similarity is caused by people discriminating based on appearance.\n(Hypothesis 2) The linguistic label of “identical twins” causes people to apply more similar treatment to such twin pairs than they do to fraternal twin pairs.\n(Hypothesis 3) Identical twins have more similar prenatal environments than fraternal twins have, and this causes greater trait similarity."

To directly test this, we can test to see which element is causal by controlling for genetic similarity using misidentified twins. Dizygotic twins who look sufficiently similar to be misclassified as monozygotic twins will preserve physical similarity- despite having only 50 percent of genetic similarity. If misidentified dizygotic twins have the same concordance for phenotype as dizygotic twins, the parsimonious explanation is that genetic difference is the causal effect in phenotypic similarity. Scarr (1968); Scarr and Saltzman (1979); Kendler et al., (1993, 1994); Xian et al., (2000); Borkenau et al., (2002); Cronk et al., (2002); Gunderson et al., (2006); Conley et al., (2013) Another interesting way to assess the causal nature of physical similarity is to see if unrelated doppelgangers have any trait similarity- which they don’t. Segal (2013); Segal et al (2013) To indirectly test this, we can look at several different types of studies that assess if phenotypic difference is environmentally incurred. For example, we know that being attractive will offer preferential treatment (Benson et al., 1976; Talamas et al., 2016; Hamermesh et al., 2019) however attractiveness is uncorrelated, if not, slightly negatively correlated with intelligence (Feingold 1992; Mitchem 2015). Another indirect measurement is to see if sex-effects overpower zygosity at all since we would reasonably assume environments treat males and females differently. There however is not much effect. (Polderman et al., 2015; Stringer et al., 2017) BUT the linguistic label of “identical twins” causes people to apply more similar treatment to such twin pairs than they do to fraternal twin pairs. Identical twins who are accidently labeled as fraternal twins throughout their entire lifetime actually turn out more phenotypically similar than correctly classified twins. (Scarr and Carter-Saltzman 1979; Conley et al., 2013) Perhaps the label “identical” makes people strive for independent individuation. This phenomenon, if anything, would bias heritability estimates down rather than up."

Marceau (2016) is a review of the literature on the prenatal environment and concludes that if anything, “results do, however, consistently suggest that heritability estimates are underestimated for measures of birth weight and early growth when chorionicity is not taken into account.” This finding mirrors Scarr (1968) which said “If this antenatal environmental bias exists [differences in antenatal nourishment, especially in monochorial MZ twins], it reduces rather than raises genetic estimates by introducing environmental differences between genetically identical twins.”\nInterestingly, prenatal effects do not seem likely to be a source of any long term effects (Dulal et al., 2018) and maternal genotype may strongly influence prenatal environment anyway.

There are 3.2 billion nucleotides in the human genome (Brown 2002) and 4,000 detectable SNPs across 3 million people related to educational attainment (Okbay et al. 2022) This means that if we assume that mutations happen randomly across all nucleotides, there is a phenomenally low possibility that a mutation occurs in the specific set of tagged SNPs that are influencing the relevant phenotype. Additionally, even if it does influence one of the SNPs that influence the relevant phenotype, this does not automatically indicate that the variability will change since the majority of mutations are neutral in their effects. (CK-12 2021) Even if the mutation is negative or positive, this will likely be undetected by twin studies since each SNP accounts for a very small percentage of the behavioral variability. (meaning probably relevant untagged SNPs make up an even smaller chunk of variability) (Chabris et al. 2015) And finally, even if there was some detectable influence of phenotype that disrupted concordance, this would actually bias heritability estimates down, rather than up."

(Segal 2013; Segal, Graham, and Ettinger 2013) To indirectly test this, we can look at several different types of studies that assess if phenotypic difference is environmentally incurred. For example, we know that being attractive will offer preferential treatment (Benson, Karabenick, and Lerner 1976; Talamas, Mavor, and Perrett 2016; Hamermesh, Gordon, and Crosnoe 2019) however attractiveness is uncorrelated, if not, slightly negatively correlated with intelligence (Feingold 1992; Mitchem et al. 2015). Another indirect measurement is to see if sex-effects overpower zygosity at all since we would reasonably assume environments treat males and females differently. There however is not much effect (Polderman et al. 2015; Stringer, Polderman, and Posthuma 2017)."

(Hypothesis 2)\nIdentical twins who are accidently labeled as fraternal twins throughout their entire lifetime actually turn out more phenotypically similar than correctly classified twins (Scarr and Carter-Saltzman 1979; Conley et al. 2013). Perhaps the label “identical” makes people strive for independent individuation. This phenomenon, if anything, would bias heritability estimates down rather than up."

    "text": "2.7 BUT identical twins have more similar prenatal environments than fraternal twins have, and this causes greater trait similarity. (Hypothesis 3)\nIdentical twins are not more similar than fraternal twins because of prenatal effects. About 1 in 4 pairs monozygotic twins do not share a single chorion and so have separate placentas. A large body of evidence shows that “monochorionic” monozygotic twins are no more similar to each other than “dichorionic” monozygotic twins are to each other. (Van Beijsterveldt et al. 2016). Marceau et al. (2016) is a review of the literature on the prenatal environment and concludes that if anything, “results do, however, consistently suggest that heritability estimates are underestimated for measures of birth weight and early growth when chorionicity is not taken into account.” This finding mirrors Scarr (1982) which said “If this antenatal environmental bias exists [differences in antenatal nourishment, especially in monochorial MZ twins], it reduces rather than raises genetic estimates by introducing environmental differences between genetically identical twins.”\nInterestingly, prenatal effects do not seem likely to be a source of any long term effects (Dulal et al. 2018) and maternal genotype may strongly influence prenatal environment anyway.

    "text": "3.1 BUT Galton ignored possible environmental factors for the children of eminent people to be eminent as well.\nGalton specifically avoids this: in the beginning of Hereditary Genius he writes: “I must not compare the sons of eminent men with those of non-eminent, because much of which I should ascribe to breed, others might ascribe to parental encouragement and example” (Galton 1891, 37). It was precisely for this reason that he undertook to compare the proportion of eminent people among the biological children of eminent people with adopted sons of Popes and other dignitaries of the Roman Catholic Church, in the attempt to disentangle possibly confounding influences from heredity and environment. In his own words: “If social help is really of the highest importance, the nephews [adopted children] of the Popes will attain eminence as frequently, or nearly so, as the sons of other eminent men; otherwise, they will not” (Galton 1891, 42). And the data clearly indicated a significant difference between the two groups, leading Galton to conclude that the environmental explanation could not be the whole story. This does not prove that Galton was right, of course, but it does show that his argument was immensely more sophisticated than Moore pictured it.\nBUT Galton never pointed out that more than half his “geniuses” turned up in families with no history of distinction at all. Galton did point out that among poets, musicians, painters, divines, and scholars, more than half of the illustrious men came from families with no history of distinction (Galton 1891, 228, 239, 249, 274, 283, 300). This methodological criticism is both factually incorrect and entirely irrelevant. First, Furthermore, summing up the information for all the professions that he considered, Galton concluded from his tabulated data that, cumulatively, “exactly one-half of the illustrious men have one or more eminent relations” (Galton 1891, 322),from which it deductively follows that one-half of the illustrious men did not have any eminent relations. Second, it is unclear why Jones thinks that the fact of more than half of geniuses turning up in families with no distinction would create a problem for Galton’s hereditarianism. Since Galton’s illustrious men were selected in such a way that their ratio to the general population was 1 to 4,000, the hereditarian explanation could easily accommodate the proportion of eminent people from no-distinction families significantly higher than 50 percent."

    "text": "3.2 BUT Ronald A. Fisher once called heritability “one of those unfortunate shortcuts, which have often emerged in biometry for lack of a more thorough analysis of the data” (Fisher 1951: 217).\nFirst, Fisher’s paper addressed issues connected with animal breeding problems. Fisher’s argument seems to be an inappropriate instrument for their human behavioral genetics. Second, Fisher happily used heritability in his book, “The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection” where he talks about “the fraction of the total observable variance of the measurement, which may be regarded as genetic variance” (Fisher 1930: 33). He left that part unchanged in the significantly revised second edition of 1958. Many times, he additionally talked about heritable variation (Bennett 1983: 140), about the genetic component of variance vs. total phenotypic variance (Bennett 1983: 228). Elsewhere, again, Fisher praised Galton for trying to give numerical precision to concepts like “the strength of inheritance”, or heritability. (Fisher 1959:2) Third, Fisher’s disparaging comment about heritability was far from being universally accepted. His worry was mainly about the heritability value being under undue influences of measurement error and changes in population parameters. For instance, his view was criticized by Johansson for “missing the important point that for practical breeding work we need estimates of heritability that are valid under the conditions where they will be applied” (Johansson 1961: 9). Fourth, Fisher’s grounds for dissatisfaction with heritability were completely different from the reasons of the critics who quote him in support of their own views. In the opinion of most of the authors who cite Fisher, one of the main problems with heritability is that genetic variance (the numerator) cannot be determined because of the confounding influence of gene–environment interaction. But Fisher himself had nothing but contempt for this kind of criticism, as seen from his letter to the son of Charles Darwin in 1935: “There is one point in which Hogben and his associates are riding for a fall, and that is in making a great song about the possible, but unproved, importance of non-linear interactions between hereditary and environmental factors. J. B. S. Haldane seems tempted to join in this” (Bennett 1983: 260). It is rather funny that contemporary critics of heritability (some of them doing research in history of biology!) press the interaction objection, which Lewontin basically took over from Hogben (1933), and then even present Fisher as their ally in this. By the way, Fisher’s judgment that Haldane “seems tempted to join in this” proved correct. Haldane’s book in which he defended Hogben’s position on interactions soon followed (Haldane 1938). Fifth, while there is nothing wrong with these authors trying to support their opposition to human behavior genetics by relying on Fisher as a supreme authority in genetics (after all, he was one of the architects of the Modern Synthesis), they should be aware that they might not find his other views about genetics so appealing. Some of them would probably be shocked to know that, despite his derogatory aside about heritability, Fisher actually believed that genetics supports the heritability of racial differences in intelligence. At about the same time that he wrote the article they quote, he suggested the following formulation for the UNESCO statement on race: “Available scientific knowledge provides a firm basis for believing that the groups of mankind differ in their innate capacity for intellectual and emotional development, seeing that such groups differ undoubtedly in a very large number of their genes” (quoted in Provine 1986: 875 – italics added). This shows that one should be careful in choosing one’s authorities because they can force one to go in an unwanted direction.\nBUT Morton mismeasured skulls Gould uses his expertise in biology to claim that Morton had bias and mismeasured a set of skulls to conclude craniometric differences between ancestral populations. The set of 201 skulls from the Morton collection were re-examined in 1986 by John S. Michael in which the results were presented in a paper published in Current Anthropology. (Michael 1988) Michael found that the differences reported by Morton were basically corroborated by his remeasurements. Michaels strongly outlines his scientific and philosophical differences with Morton but concludes that he could find no indication of the systematic bias that Gould ascribed to Morton, and that in his opinion, “Morton’s research was conducted with integrity” (Michael 1988: 353).\nMorton’s discovery is accepted today in standard reference books (see Sternberg 1982: 773; Brody 1992: 301; Mackintosh 1998: 184), and even by mainstream environmentarians like Ulric Neisser. As a responsible psychologist who knows that this kind of dispute is ultimately resolved by empirical verification, he had no other choice but to concede that with respect to the racial differences in the mean measured sizes of skulls and brains, “there is indeed a small overall trend in the direction [Lynn and Rushton] describe” (Neisser 1997: 80)\nBUT Burt faked twin data (revise later) The claim that Burt “made up” the evidence in his twin studies is just one opinion in the ongoing debate about the whole affair. The fraud theory was, for example, strongly disputed in two books devoted to the Burt case (Joynson 1989; Fletcher 1991) and in several scholarly articles. Even Mackintosh, who enjoys the reputation of a fair and impartial commentator, concluded his detailed analysis of the topic in this way: “If the MZ twin data were the only grounds for accusing Burt of fraud, one would probably have to give him the benefit of the doubt” (Mackintosh 1995b: 68). Critics do not seem to be aware that with this assertion that Burt’s data were all made up, they have a problem of how to explain the fact that some of the best contemporary studies agree quite well with these alleged total fabrications. For example, recently several behavior geneticists laughingly said that they were “grateful as hell” that in their study of monozygotic twins reared apart, the IQ correlation turned out to be .78, and so mercifully not bang identical to the infamous magnitude of .77, reported by Burt (Miele 2002: 99–100).\nBUT Burt’s theories led to the eleven plus exams Britain’s notorious “11+ examination” was not a creation of psychometricians led by Cyril Burt; it developed slowly out of the “free place examination” for grammar school scholarships, instituted before any IQ tests existed. The testers’ growing influence produced the eventual inclusion of an IQ test and a new rationale for 11+, but not the examination itself or its social functions. (Samelson 1982:656) Whatever Gould … or Kamin … may say, Burt was certainly not responsible for the institution of the 11+ exam in English schools after the 1944 Education Act, let alone for the practice of selection for “free places” in secondary schools in the 1920s and 1930s. Selection was already built into the system: the only question at issue was the basis on which it was to occur. (Mackintosh 1995a: 95, italics supplied) IQ tests were thus not used to establish a system of selective secondary education. That system was already in effect.

The testers’ growing influence produced the eventual inclusion of an IQ test and a new rationale for 11+, but not the examination itself or its social functions. (Samelson 1982, 656)\nNJ Mackintosh (1995) states, “Whatever Gould … or Kamin … may say, Burt was certainly not responsible for the institution of the 11+ exam in English schools after the 1944 Education Act, let alone for the practice of selection for “free places” in secondary schools in the 1920s and 1930s. Selection was already built into the system: the only question at issue was the basis on which it was to occur.”\nIQ tests were thus not used to establish a system of selective secondary education.

Every behavioral geneticist believes that each individual is the product of the totality of their genes being expressed in the totality of their environment. (A. Jensen 2012, 50) Whether or not the influences of genetics and environments can be disentangled is a matter of empirics. (Wright et al. 2015)\nIf all humans were genotypically identical or if all humans lived in perfectly similar environments, there would be no need for heritability estimates since we could attribute all variation to environmental or genetic factors respectively. Since people with different genes live in different environments, we then have an interplay between the two that produce phenotypic variation. Heritability estimates are the tools we can use to measure an observed variation of phenotype to attribute the respective portion to genetic and environmental influence."

Genes and environment typically interact (in the statistical sense) to produce phenotypes.\nThe rarity of a significant statistical interaction between genes and environment has been established for several decades. Any significant amount of non-additive or GxE variation has largely been “purely a speculation about as yet untested environmental conditions” which even at the time most of the twin studies were criticized, “data concerning normal people moved around within common environmental situations show their norm of reaction for IQ to be in fact rather flat.” (Havender 1976, 609) Additionally, there is no conspiracy against interaction. If an interactive model could be shown to fit the data better than the traditional model, researchers would be quick to use it. (Robert Plomin 1990, 144). Polderman et al. (2015) surveyed every prior twin study and found that “for a majority of traits (69%), the observed statistics are consistent with a simple and parsimonious model where the observed variation is solely due to additive genetic variation. The data are inconsistent with a substantial influence …non-additive genetic variation.” Intelligence was not fully explained by an additive model. GxE and Non-additive genetic variance of complex traits tends to either be very low, or negligible. With dominant genetic effects lower than epistatic. (W. G.

    "text": "3.6 BUT genetic contribution for ‘g’ or cognitive ability is non-additive\nThere are two ways to determine if the genetic influence of traits are non-additive. Through twin and family estimations and molecular biological estimates- each method having unique advantages. (Robert Plomin and Von Stumm 2018)\nWith twin and family data, we have discovered that genetic effects on g seem to be largely additive. (Robert Plomin 1999) Large twin studies like Haworth et al. (2009) and Robert Plomin and Thompson (2007) found that all genetic influence was additive for the entire distribution of intelligence. (see also Robert Plomin and Deary 2014) Since assortative mating naturally increases additivity, estimates after controlling for this find that the majority of the genetic effect to be additive using twin and family data. (Chipuer, Rovine, and Plomin 1990; Vinkhuyzen et al. 2012)\nA newer way to measure the genetic variance of a trait that relies on different methodological assumptions than twin and family studies is through molecular biological estimates. (Maciej Trzaskowski et al. 2013) Since complex traits are often extremely polygenic, it is unlikely for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to fully capture the effect of genetic additive influence, thus, it is understood that these analyses provide a lower bound for measuring the variance of additive genetic influence on traits. (Li et al. 2019) By using genome-wide complex trait analyses (GCTA), however, we can boost genomic coverage and thus increase the estimate for genetic variance. (Yang, Manolio, et al. 2011; William David Hill et al. 2019) The significance of this method is that it can estimate the net effect of genetic influence using DNA of unrelated individuals rather than relying on familial resemblance in groups of special family members such as monozygotic and dizygotic twins who differ in genetic relatedness. (Robert Plomin and Deary 2014) Additionally, GCTA is limited to detecting the additive effects of SNPs; it cannot detect gene–gene or gene–environment interaction. (Yang, Lee, et al. 2011) An earlier GCTA from (M. Trzaskowski et al. 2014) found DNA-estimated heritabilities increased from 0.26 at age 7 to 0.45 at age 12- roughly matching twin data. W. David Hill et al. (2018), a newer study, finds that over 50 percent of differences in intelligence can be explained by genetic effects when a larger number of rare SNPs are included- which matches both current and historical heritability estimates with twin and family models on average.

Therefore, heritability claims are not generalizable.\nFirst, no one denies that heritability is a population level statistic:\n\n“Heritability is not a constant that holds for all groups or in all environments.” (Rushton and Jensen 2005)\n“Heritability is a population statistic and the heritability of intelligence may be expected to vary in different populations”; (Lynn and Harvey 2008)\n“The heritability of a trait may change when the conditions producing variation change” (Herrnstein and Murray 2010).\n\nThough heritability is a population level statistic, this doesn’t mean we should be surprised to see estimates that can be generalized under the right conditions. “[W]henever a value is stated for the heritability of a given character it must be understood to refer to a particular population under particular conditions. Values found in other populations under other circumstances will be more or less the same according to whether the structure of the population and the environmental conditions are more or less alike”. (Falconer 1996) The question of generalizing [genetic variability] to other samples and other times can only be answered empirically (the evidence with respect to cognitive abilities suggests considerable generalizability). (Robert Plomin and DeFries 1976, 11)\n“Although heritability could differ in different cultures, moderate heritability of g has been found, not only in twin studies in North American and western European countries, but also in Moscow, former East Germany, rural India, urban India, and Japan” (R. Plomin 2002)1. Pesta et al. (2020) found that White, Black, and Hispanic heritabilities were consistently moderate to high, and that these heritabilities did not differ across groups in the United States.\nTo radically say that heritability estimates are not at all generalizable even across state lines (Moore 2002, 47), would be akin to saying that teaching interventions that work in one state has no generalizability to another.\nWhile some critics have cited the non-experimental nature of human behavioral genetics as a serious methodological deficiency (Michel and Moore 1995, 209), this ironically may actually work in its favor in the context of real world natural experiments versus laboratory experimentation. Not dealing with artificial, laboratory conditions but with real-life situations, its conclusions obtained on given samples are easier to extrapolate to other similar populations (see Winkler and Murphy 1973). Human behavioral genetic researchers have the mixed blessing of working with naturally occurring genetic and environmental variation. The cost is a loss of experimental control; the benefit is an increased likelihood that the result of the research will generalize (Robert Plomin, DeFries, and Fulker 1988, 231; R. Plomin 1986, 99; Robert Plomin and Hershberger 1991, 33)"

    "text": "3.9 BUT the rising heritability of intelligence with age is due to GxE interaction\nSee here\nDeary et al. (2012) reported a rather strong genetic correlation (0.62) between IQ measured at age 11 and IQ measured at age 65-79 in a large scottish sample (N=1,940). In another longitudinal sample, Brant et al. (2009) p. 401-402 report positive genetic correlations between IQs measured at age 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 12, 16, that tend to increase with age, “signifying that the same genetic effects are evident from infancy to late adolescence, but that these influences increase in importance across development”. Lyons et al. (2009) show a phenotypic correlation for AFQT, a highly g-loaded test, measured at age 20 (N=7,232) and 55 (N=1,237), at about 0.74, for which the genetic correlation was 1.0. The fact that Lyons et al. (2009) found no new genetic influences over the adult development is interesting. Brant et al. (2013) found that the genetic influence during the cognitive development comes both from previous, existing genetic influences and new influences; the authors also report a lower heritability for high-IQ people, and a higher heritability for lower-IQ people (N=11,000). Brant, nevertheless, seems to reject a commonly invoked theory for explaining the rise in heritability, namely, the active GxE correlational model :\n\nThe most prominent theory of developmental increases in the heritability of IQ posits that across development, individuals gain more scope to shape their own environments on the basis of their genetic propensities (active gene-environment correlation), which causes an increase in genetic influence over time (Haworth et al., 2010; Plomin, DeFries, & Loehlin, 1977). Our results challenge this explanation, as they show a later increase in heritability for individuals of higher IQ. To explain our results in the context of active gene-environment correlations, one would need to posit, counterintuitively, that higher-IQ individuals seek out environments concordant with their genetic propensities later in development than do lower-IQ individuals.\n\nThe plausibility of their hypothesis is supported by the fact that IQ differences certainly reflect differences in mental age (A. R. Jensen 1980, 559–62; 1999, 370–71). The authors are still open to the possibility of the amplification model which is, at present, perhaps the most likely and tenable hypothesis. Van Soelen et al. (2011) confirmed the amplification model in a pediatric longitudinal sample, consistent with Hoekstra, Bartels, and Boomsma (2007) p. 112 analysis, in which no clear pattern of GxE interaction has been found and in which they show a correlation between verbal and nonverbal abilities that is entirely explained by genetic effects, with stability in nonverbal ability attributed completely to genetic influences between age 5 and 18 (p. 105-109). Subsequently, Leeuwen, Berg, and Boomsma (2008) p. 78, 84-85, 86-87 also report weak effect of GxE interaction (due to nonshared environmental influences), in line with A. Jensen (2012) p. 173-174, and no evidence for cultural transmission between generations, as was also the case in most previous studies. In their best fitting model, assuming phenotypic assortment (i.e., mating based on observable characteristics such as intelligence), as opposed to the model assuming social homogamy (i.e., mating based on environmental resemblance only because spouses of same IQ level meet each other given that people with the same IQ level live in the same social environment), genetic variation contributes 58% to the variation in IQ among children and adults, with the remaining 42% accounted for by unique, nonshared environmental variation. Also, Leeuwen, Berg, and Boomsma (2008) found no evidence of cultural transmission from parents to children, consistent with previous findings (Robert Plomin et al. 1997). Reminding this is essential because under the GxE correlational model, as is the case in Dickens & Flynn, it is assumed that parents transmit no only their genes but also their environment.\nMore recently, Briley and Tucker-Drob (2013) meta-analysis demonstrates that new genetic influences (innovation; e.g., novel biological changes such as hormonal changes associated with puberty, or environmental changes such as transition from the home to grade school) are likely to explain the increase in heritability at the very early stage of development, but beginning at age 8, genetic amplification becomes predominant, and the effect of new genetic influences drops to zero; the widening of the shaded area (i.e., standard error) with regard to amplification suggests that this parameter is not estimated with much precision, but the authors maintain that their alternative models show the very same phenomenon but more precisely (Figures S3 & S4). In any case, this does not square well with the Dickens-Flynn hypothesis. And thus the fact that Briley and Tucker-Drob (2013) cited Dickens and Flynn (2001) as an illustration of the evidence in favor of the amplification model is a curious non-sequitur.\nMuch (to all) of the information above is scraped from Hu (2013)."

    "text": "3.10 BUT something about generalist genes not existing\nThe generalist genes hypothesis (Kovas and Plomin 2006a, 2006b), advanced by Robert Plomin, posits that the same genes that influence, say, school achievement, will also account for IQ test scores, or a cognitive area (math) correlated with another cognitive area (verbal) due to the same genetic influences. In this way, the correlation between these two variables is due to genetic effects. The two key concepts to understand the theory are pleiotropy (a single gene affecting several traits) and polygenicity (each trait is affected by a multitude of genes), the latter reinforcing the former. The theory received a considerable support from numerous studies on very large sample size (Robert Plomin and Kovas 2005; Robert Plomin, Kovas, and Haworth 2007; Haworth, Dale, and Plomin 2009; Docherty et al. 2010; O. Davis, Haworth, and Plomin 2009; Calvin et al. 2012; Chow et al. 2013)\nGCTA also succeeds to replicate classical twin analyses. The genetic correlations between g and language, mathematics, reading, height, weight, reveal a great similarity between GCTA and twin estimates (Trzaskowski et al., 2013b).\nRobert Plomin and Kovas (2005) Tables 4 & 5 mention that high rG (Correlations between the latent genetic influences on each trait) also is prevalent for cognitive disability, as reading and math disability had an rG of 0.53. Within mathematics, ability and disability are also genetically correlated, with rG of 0.88. Within reading, ability and disability show rG between 0.70 and 0.90. Within language, ability and disability show rG between 0.60 and 0.90. Comorbidity, the correlation of one (dis)ability with another (dis)ability, is also evident. Bivariate heritability analyses through “DF extremes” (DeFries-Fulker) method yield large estimates between, say, reading disability and math ability. This indicates that one gene found for a certain disability will have a high chance to be associated with ability in some other cognitive domain. Deficits in processes are not genetically independent. Robert Plomin, Kovas, and Haworth (2007) write in this matter :\n\nA common reaction to this conclusion about generalist genes is disbelief because it goes against the common observation that specific disabilities exist. That is, some children with reading problems have no problem with mathematics and vice versa. If genes are generalists, why do specific disabilities occur? There are three reasons. First, genes are also specialists – genetic correlations are not 1.0. Second, nonshared environments are largely specialists (Plomin & Kovas, in press-b). Third, there is less specificity than it might seem. Even though reading and mathematics correlate phenotypically 0.65 in TEDS, some children with reading problems have no problems with mathematics and vice versa. However, this so-called double dissociation is to be expected on statistical grounds alone and has no bearing on the extent to which different causal processes affect reading and mathematics. A related issue concerning the acceptance of these findings is that, although genetic correlations between learning abilities are greater than their phenotypic correlations, we cannot see genetic correlations in the population in the way that we can see phenotypic associations and dissociations.\n\nPosthuma et al. (2003) and Deary, Spinath, and Bates (2006) propose a review of studies showing genetic correlation between g and brain volume, g and cognitive processing (reaction time, inspection time), and in particular the IQ-IT covariance (Luciano et al. 2005) as evidence that a pleiotropic gene model, unlike causal models, has been proved to be the best fitting model, in a large sample (N=2012), hence validating a genetic g hypothesis but not any of the proposed causal paths, either top-down or bottom-up : “In short, there is no causal relationship between IT and IQ; instead, both processes/abilities are partially dependent on the same underlying cause, which analysis has shown to be genetic”. Luciano et al. (2004) had previously demonstrated the existence of a higher-order genetic g among chronometric tests. g is not only confined to psychometric tests. The strong genetic correlations between different cognitive domains (g factor, math, language, reading), usually higher than 0.50, sometimes approaching 1.0, is suggestive of a genetic g.\nMuch (to all) of the information above is scraped from Hu (2013)."

    "text": "3.11 BUT missing heritability\nIf all the genes responsible for the heritability of traits could be identified, there would no longer be any need for twin or adoption studies. However, there is a great gap between genes identified so far in GWA studies and heritability estimates— the missing-heritability problem (Maher 2008). One of the most far-reaching results of GWA studies is to show that there are no genes of large effect size in the population, which means that the heritability of complex traits is probably due to many genes of small effect size, and this means that associations will be difficult to detect and replicate (Robert Plomin 2013). For example, the first GWA studies of general cognitive ability (Davies et al. 2011; O. S. Davis et al. 2010) were powered to detect associations that account for as little as .01 of the variance, but they came up empty-handed because the associations with the largest effect accounted for less than .005 of the variance. One of many possible reasons for the missing-heritability problem is that the common SNPs (i.e., SNPs for which the frequency of the less frequent allele is greater than .01) incorporated in commercially available DNA arrays miss the contribution of rare DNA variants (Cirulli and Goldstein 2010). Another possibility is that heritability has been overestimated by twin and adoption studies.\nWikipedia includes the following from their page on the missing heritability problem:\n\nThis resolution to the missing heritability problem was supported by the introduction of Genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA) in 2010, which demonstrated that trait similarity could be predicted by the genetic similarity of unrelated strangers on common SNPs treated additively, and for many traits the SNP heritability was indeed a substantial fraction of the overall heritability. The GCTA results were further supported by findings that a small percent of trait variance could be predicted in GWASes without any genome-wide statistically-significant hits by a linear model including all SNPs regardless of p-value; if there were no SNP contribution, this would be unlikely, but it would be what one expected from SNPs whose effects were very imprecisely estimated by a too-small sample. Combined with the upper bound on maximum effect sizes set by the GWASes up to then, this strongly implied that the highly polygenic theory was correct. Examples of complex traits where increasingly large-scale GWASes have yielded the initial hits and then increasing numbers of hits as sample sizes increased from n&lt;20k to n&gt;100k or n&gt;300k include height, educational attainment, and schizophrenia.\n\nMissing heritability is found in GWAS with big enough sample sizes (Kuchenbaecker 2022). Yengo et al. (2022) finds all relavent snips using 21% of the genome (non-hidden heritability SNPs). Compared with previous attemps:\n\nLango Allen et al. (2010) with n=183,727 find 180 SNPs totaling to 10 percent SNP heritability\nWood et al. (2014) with n=253,288 find 697 SNPs totaling to 20 percent SNP heritability\nYengo et al. (2022) with n=5,380,080 find 12,111 SNPs totaling to 45 percent SNP heritability\n\nwe have been able to find much of the heritability what has been supposedly missing from twin studies. In general, twin studies show that height is roughly 60-70 percent heritable meaning that if we were to expand the amount of genome we were searching on, we could potentially catch up to the estimated percent.\nGWAS on educational attainment shows this trend as well:\n\n\n\nOkbay et al. (2022)\n\n\nAs stated in Okbay et al. (2022), GWAS can currently predict roughly 12 percent of variation in educational attainment. Twin studies show that the heritability of educational attainment is roughly 50-60 percent, so as the sample size increases, perhaps this “missing heritability problem” will be resolved as well.\n\n\n\n\nBrant, Angela M, Brett C Haberstick, Robin P Corley, Sally J Wadsworth, John C DeFries, and John K Hewitt. 2009. “The Developmental Etiology of High IQ.” Behavior Genetics 39: 393–405.\n\n\nBrant, Angela M, Yuko Munakata, Dorret I Boomsma, John C DeFries, Claire MA Haworth, Matthew C Keller, Nicholas G Martin, et al. 2013. “The Nature and Nurture of High IQ: An Extended Sensitive Period for Intellectual Development.” Psychological Science 24 (8): 1487–95.\n\n\nBriley, Daniel, and Elliot Tucker-Drob. 2013. “Explaining the Increasing Heritability of Cognitive Ability Across Development a Meta-Analysis of Longitudinal Twin and Adoption Studies.” Psychological Science 24 (July). https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797613478618.\n\n\nCalvin, Catherine M, Ian J Deary, Dinand Webbink, Pauline Smith, Cres Fernandes, Sang Hong Lee, Michelle Luciano, and Peter M Visscher. 2012. “Multivariate Genetic Analyses of Cognition and Academic Achievement from Two Population Samples of 174,000 and 166,000 School Children.” Behavior Genetics 42: 699–710.\n\n\nCattell, Raymond B. 1960. “The Multiple Abstract Variance Analysis Equations and Solutions: For Nature-Nurture Research on Continuous Variables.” Psychological Review 67 (6): 353.\n\n\n———. 1963. “THE INTERACTION OF HEREDITARY AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES 1.” British Journal of Statistical Psychology 16 (2): 191–210.\n\n\n———. 1965. “Methodological and Conceptual Advances in Evaluating Hereditary and Environmental Influences and Their Interaction.” In Methods and Goals in Human Behavior Genetics, 95–139.

What is taken to follow from zero heritability is only that genes are unimportant for explaining the existing phenotypic differences in the population in question (Wray and Visscher 2008). It answers the question, “Do genetic differences explain why the number of fingers differ among humans?” Second, even if a trait is shared by all organisms in a given population, it can still be heritable. When expanding the population tested with more species, now the heritability estimate will answer, “Do genetic differences explain why the number of fingers differ among organisms” 1"

Additionally, it is important to remember that heritability studies should take into account the population being studied (Wray and Visscher 2008). Block (1995) ironically explains the utility in this in his criticism of heritability. Since “only women wore earrings” historically, it would be more useful to measure men and women separately since both shared and nonshared environmental effects will give unequal effects. Furthermore, when looking within the sexes, earring use could reasonably be correlated with grandiosity- a trait that seems to be moderately heritable (Luo and Cai 2018)."

To better illustrate why the bucket analogy would be problematic for comparison, if we assume that replacing Billy or Suzy with another Billy or Suzy would change a measure of the bucket3 then we can absolutely quantify the respective variance to a population of buckets with the respective variance attributed to interchanging Billys and Suzys."

    "text": "2.4 BUT if two men build a wall where one “mixes the mortar and the other lays the bricks, it would be absurd to measure their relative quantitative contributions by measuring the volumes of bricks and of mortar.” (Lewontin 1976, 181–82)\nLet us modify the brick–mortar situation in these two respects in order to make it as similar as possible to the heredity– environment problem.4\nFirst, instead of discussing an individual wall, we will discuss a population of potential walls. And second, instead of trying to measure the contributions of different quantities of bricks and mortar, we will attempt to measure the contributions of qualities of bricks and mortar. Suppose there are three kinds of bricks (B1, B2, and B3) and three kinds of mortar (M1, M2, and M3). We want to measure the contributions of these different kinds of bricks and mortar to the stability of walls that arise out of nine different B–M combinations.\n\nHere is the translation manual for the analogy: bricks are genes, mortar is environment, and wall stability is phenotype. The figure above shows a hypothetical distribution of stability values for nine walls (all possible B–M combinations). Now, does it make sense here to quantify the contributions of bricks and mortar? Yes, it does. We see from the graph that switching from one kind of brick to another makes a much bigger difference to the wall stability than changing the kind of mortar. The main effect of B is 5 and the main effect of M is 1. If we want further numerical precision, a simple ANOVA calculation tells us that the variation in stability of these walls is 97 percent due to the brick variation and only 3 percent to the mortar variation. The relation between the two causes is completely additive, and there is no brick–mortar interaction (in the statistical sense).\nNotice also that once the population perspective is in place, it becomes possible to quantify the contributions of the two factors even in individual cases. For instance: the wall made of bricks B1 and mortar M1 has a below-average stability exclusively because of the below-average quality of its bricks."

(Wright et al. 2015)\nIf all humans were genotypically identical or if all humans lived in perfectly similar environments, there would be no need for heritability estimates since we could attribute all variation to environmental or genetic factors respectively. Since people with different genes live in different environments, we then have an interplay between the two that produce phenotypic variation.

Genes and environment typically interact (in the statistical sense) to produce phenotypes.\nThe rarity of a significant statistical interaction between genes and environment has been established for several decades. Any significant amount of non-additive or GxE variation has largely been “purely a speculation about as yet untested environmental conditions” which even at the time most of the twin studies were criticized, “data concerning normal people moved around within common environmental situations show their norm of reaction for IQ to be in fact rather flat.” (Havender 1976, 609) Additionally, there is no conspiracy against interaction. If an interactive model could be shown to fit the data better than the traditional model, researchers would be quick to use it. (Robert Plomin 1990, 144). Polderman et al.

Through twin and family estimations and molecular biological estimates- each method having unique advantages. (Robert Plomin and Von Stumm 2018)\nWith twin and family data, we have discovered that genetic effects on g seem to be largely additive. (Robert Plomin 1999) Large twin studies like Haworth et al. (2009) and Robert Plomin and Thompson (2007) found that all genetic influence was additive for the entire distribution of intelligence. (see also Robert Plomin and Deary 2014) Since assortative mating naturally increases additivity, estimates after controlling for this find that the majority of the genetic effect to be additive using twin and family data. (Chipuer, Rovine, and Plomin 1990; Vinkhuyzen et al. 2012)\nA newer way to measure the genetic variance of a trait that relies on different methodological assumptions than twin and family studies is through molecular biological estimates. (Maciej Trzaskowski et al. 2013) Since complex traits are often extremely polygenic, it is unlikely for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to fully capture the effect of genetic additive influence, thus, it is understood that these analyses provide a lower bound for measuring the variance of additive genetic influence on traits. (Li et al. 2019) By using genome-wide complex trait analyses (GCTA), however, we can boost genomic coverage and thus increase the estimate for genetic variance. (Yang, Manolio, et al. 2011; William David Hill et al. 2019) The significance of this method is that it can estimate the net effect of genetic influence using DNA of unrelated individuals rather than relying on familial resemblance in groups of special family members such as monozygotic and dizygotic twins who differ in genetic relatedness. (Robert Plomin and Deary 2014) Additionally, GCTA is limited to detecting the additive effects of SNPs; it cannot detect gene–gene or gene–environment interaction. (Yang, Lee, et al. 2011) An earlier GCTA from (M. Trzaskowski et al. 2014) found DNA-estimated heritabilities increased from 0.26 at age 7 to 0.45 at age 12- roughly matching twin data. W. David Hill et al. (2018), a newer study, finds that over 50 percent of differences in intelligence can be explained by genetic effects when a larger number of rare SNPs are included- which matches both current and historical heritability estimates with twin and family models on average.

Therefore, heritability claims are not generalizable.\nFirst, no one denies that heritability is a population level statistic:\n\n“Heritability is not a constant that holds for all groups or in all environments.” (Rushton and Jensen 2005)\n“Heritability is a population statistic and the heritability of intelligence may be expected to vary in different populations”; (Lynn and Harvey 2008)\n“The heritability of a trait may change when the conditions producing variation change” (Herrnstein and Murray 2010).\n\nThough heritability is a population level statistic, this doesn’t mean we should be surprised to see estimates that can be generalized under the right conditions. “[W]henever a value is stated for the heritability of a given character it must be understood to refer to a particular population under particular conditions. Values found in other populations under other circumstances will be more or less the same according to whether the structure of the population and the environmental conditions are more or less alike”. (Falconer 1996) The question of generalizing [genetic variability] to other samples and other times can only be answered empirically (the evidence with respect to cognitive abilities suggests considerable generalizability). (Robert Plomin and DeFries 1976, 11)\n“Although heritability could differ in different cultures, moderate heritability of g has been found, not only in twin studies in North American and western European countries, but also in Moscow, former East Germany, rural India, urban India, and Japan” (R. Plomin 2002)1. Pesta et al. (2020) found that White, Black, and Hispanic heritabilities were consistently moderate to high, and that these heritabilities did not differ across groups in the United States.\nTo radically say that heritability estimates are not at all generalizable even across state lines (Moore 2002, 47), would be akin to saying that teaching interventions that work in one state has no generalizability to another.\nWhile some critics have cited the non-experimental nature of human behavioral genetics as a serious methodological deficiency (Michel and Moore 1995, 209), this ironically may actually work in its favor in the context of real world natural experiments versus laboratory experimentation. Not dealing with artificial, laboratory conditions but with real-life situations, its conclusions obtained on given samples are easier to extrapolate to other similar populations (see Winkler and Murphy 1973). Human behavioral genetic researchers have the mixed blessing of working with naturally occurring genetic and environmental variation. The cost is a loss of experimental control; the benefit is an increased likelihood that the result of the research will generalize (Robert Plomin, DeFries, and Fulker 1988, 231; R. Plomin 1986, 99; Robert Plomin and Hershberger 1991, 33)"

    "text": "1.9 BUT the rising heritability of intelligence with age is due to GxE interaction\nSee here\nDeary et al. (2012) reported a rather strong genetic correlation (0.62) between IQ measured at age 11 and IQ measured at age 65-79 in a large scottish sample (N=1,940). In another longitudinal sample, Brant et al. (2009) p. 401-402 report positive genetic correlations between IQs measured at age 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 12, 16, that tend to increase with age, “signifying that the same genetic effects are evident from infancy to late adolescence, but that these influences increase in importance across development”. Lyons et al. (2009) show a phenotypic correlation for AFQT, a highly g-loaded test, measured at age 20 (N=7,232) and 55 (N=1,237), at about 0.74, for which the genetic correlation was 1.0. The fact that Lyons et al. (2009) found no new genetic influences over the adult development is interesting. Brant et al. (2013) found that the genetic influence during the cognitive development comes both from previous, existing genetic influences and new influences; the authors also report a lower heritability for high-IQ people, and a higher heritability for lower-IQ people (N=11,000). Brant, nevertheless, seems to reject a commonly invoked theory for explaining the rise in heritability, namely, the active GxE correlational model :\n\nThe most prominent theory of developmental increases in the heritability of IQ posits that across development, individuals gain more scope to shape their own environments on the basis of their genetic propensities (active gene-environment correlation), which causes an increase in genetic influence over time (Haworth et al., 2010; Plomin, DeFries, & Loehlin, 1977). Our results challenge this explanation, as they show a later increase in heritability for individuals of higher IQ. To explain our results in the context of active gene-environment correlations, one would need to posit, counterintuitively, that higher-IQ individuals seek out environments concordant with their genetic propensities later in development than do lower-IQ individuals.\n\nThe plausibility of their hypothesis is supported by the fact that IQ differences certainly reflect differences in mental age (A. R. Jensen 1980, 559–62; 1999, 370–71). The authors are still open to the possibility of the amplification model which is, at present, perhaps the most likely and tenable hypothesis. Van Soelen et al. (2011) confirmed the amplification model in a pediatric longitudinal sample, consistent with Hoekstra, Bartels, and Boomsma (2007) p. 112 analysis, in which no clear pattern of GxE interaction has been found and in which they show a correlation between verbal and nonverbal abilities that is entirely explained by genetic effects, with stability in nonverbal ability attributed completely to genetic influences between age 5 and 18 (p. 105-109). Subsequently, Leeuwen, Berg, and Boomsma (2008) p. 78, 84-85, 86-87 also report weak effect of GxE interaction (due to nonshared environmental influences), in line with A. Jensen (2012) p. 173-174, and no evidence for cultural transmission between generations, as was also the case in most previous studies. In their best fitting model, assuming phenotypic assortment (i.e., mating based on observable characteristics such as intelligence), as opposed to the model assuming social homogamy (i.e., mating based on environmental resemblance only because spouses of same IQ level meet each other given that people with the same IQ level live in the same social environment), genetic variation contributes 58% to the variation in IQ among children and adults, with the remaining 42% accounted for by unique, nonshared environmental variation. Also, Leeuwen, Berg, and Boomsma (2008) found no evidence of cultural transmission from parents to children, consistent with previous findings (Robert Plomin et al. 1997). Reminding this is essential because under the GxE correlational model, as is the case in Dickens & Flynn, it is assumed that parents transmit no only their genes but also their environment.\nMore recently, Briley and Tucker-Drob (2013) meta-analysis demonstrates that new genetic influences (innovation; e.g., novel biological changes such as hormonal changes associated with puberty, or environmental changes such as transition from the home to grade school) are likely to explain the increase in heritability at the very early stage of development, but beginning at age 8, genetic amplification becomes predominant, and the effect of new genetic influences drops to zero; the widening of the shaded area (i.e., standard error) with regard to amplification suggests that this parameter is not estimated with much precision, but the authors maintain that their alternative models show the very same phenomenon but more precisely (Figures S3 & S4). In any case, this does not square well with the Dickens-Flynn hypothesis. And thus the fact that Briley and Tucker-Drob (2013) cited Dickens and Flynn (2001) as an illustration of the evidence in favor of the amplification model is a curious non-sequitur.\nMuch (to all) of the information above is scraped from Hu (2013)."

    "text": "1.10 BUT something about generalist genes not existing\nThe generalist genes hypothesis (Kovas and Plomin 2006a, 2006b), advanced by Robert Plomin, posits that the same genes that influence, say, school achievement, will also account for IQ test scores, or a cognitive area (math) correlated with another cognitive area (verbal) due to the same genetic influences. In this way, the correlation between these two variables is due to genetic effects. The two key concepts to understand the theory are pleiotropy (a single gene affecting several traits) and polygenicity (each trait is affected by a multitude of genes), the latter reinforcing the former. The theory received a considerable support from numerous studies on very large sample size (Robert Plomin and Kovas 2005; Robert Plomin, Kovas, and Haworth 2007; Haworth, Dale, and Plomin 2009; Docherty et al. 2010; O. Davis, Haworth, and Plomin 2009; Calvin et al. 2012; Chow et al. 2013)\nGCTA also succeeds to replicate classical twin analyses. The genetic correlations between g and language, mathematics, reading, height, weight, reveal a great similarity between GCTA and twin estimates (Trzaskowski et al., 2013b).\nRobert Plomin and Kovas (2005) Tables 4 & 5 mention that high rG (Correlations between the latent genetic influences on each trait) also is prevalent for cognitive disability, as reading and math disability had an rG of 0.53. Within mathematics, ability and disability are also genetically correlated, with rG of 0.88. Within reading, ability and disability show rG between 0.70 and 0.90. Within language, ability and disability show rG between 0.60 and 0.90. Comorbidity, the correlation of one (dis)ability with another (dis)ability, is also evident. Bivariate heritability analyses through “DF extremes” (DeFries-Fulker) method yield large estimates between, say, reading disability and math ability. This indicates that one gene found for a certain disability will have a high chance to be associated with ability in some other cognitive domain. Deficits in processes are not genetically independent. Robert Plomin, Kovas, and Haworth (2007) write in this matter :\n\nA common reaction to this conclusion about generalist genes is disbelief because it goes against the common observation that specific disabilities exist. That is, some children with reading problems have no problem with mathematics and vice versa. If genes are generalists, why do specific disabilities occur? There are three reasons. First, genes are also specialists – genetic correlations are not 1.0. Second, nonshared environments are largely specialists (Plomin & Kovas, in press-b). Third, there is less specificity than it might seem. Even though reading and mathematics correlate phenotypically 0.65 in TEDS, some children with reading problems have no problems with mathematics and vice versa. However, this so-called double dissociation is to be expected on statistical grounds alone and has no bearing on the extent to which different causal processes affect reading and mathematics. A related issue concerning the acceptance of these findings is that, although genetic correlations between learning abilities are greater than their phenotypic correlations, we cannot see genetic correlations in the population in the way that we can see phenotypic associations and dissociations.\n\nPosthuma et al. (2003) and Deary, Spinath, and Bates (2006) propose a review of studies showing genetic correlation between g and brain volume, g and cognitive processing (reaction time, inspection time), and in particular the IQ-IT covariance (Luciano et al. 2005) as evidence that a pleiotropic gene model, unlike causal models, has been proved to be the best fitting model, in a large sample (N=2012), hence validating a genetic g hypothesis but not any of the proposed causal paths, either top-down or bottom-up : “In short, there is no causal relationship between IT and IQ; instead, both processes/abilities are partially dependent on the same underlying cause, which analysis has shown to be genetic”. Luciano et al. (2004) had previously demonstrated the existence of a higher-order genetic g among chronometric tests. g is not only confined to psychometric tests. The strong genetic correlations between different cognitive domains (g factor, math, language, reading), usually higher than 0.50, sometimes approaching 1.0, is suggestive of a genetic g.\nMuch (to all) of the information above is scraped from Hu (2013)."

    "text": "1.11 BUT missing heritability\nIf all the genes responsible for the heritability of traits could be identified, there would no longer be any need for twin or adoption studies. However, there is a great gap between genes identified so far in GWA studies and heritability estimates— the missing-heritability problem (Maher 2008). One of the most far-reaching results of GWA studies is to show that there are no genes of large effect size in the population, which means that the heritability of complex traits is probably due to many genes of small effect size, and this means that associations will be difficult to detect and replicate (Robert Plomin 2013). For example, the first GWA studies of general cognitive ability (Davies et al. 2011; O. S. Davis et al. 2010) were powered to detect associations that account for as little as .01 of the variance, but they came up empty-handed because the associations with the largest effect accounted for less than .005 of the variance. One of many possible reasons for the missing-heritability problem is that the common SNPs (i.e., SNPs for which the frequency of the less frequent allele is greater than .01) incorporated in commercially available DNA arrays miss the contribution of rare DNA variants (Cirulli and Goldstein 2010). Another possibility is that heritability has been overestimated by twin and adoption studies.\nWikipedia includes the following from their page on the missing heritability problem:\n\nThis resolution to the missing heritability problem was supported by the introduction of Genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA) in 2010, which demonstrated that trait similarity could be predicted by the genetic similarity of unrelated strangers on common SNPs treated additively, and for many traits the SNP heritability was indeed a substantial fraction of the overall heritability. The GCTA results were further supported by findings that a small percent of trait variance could be predicted in GWASes without any genome-wide statistically-significant hits by a linear model including all SNPs regardless of p-value; if there were no SNP contribution, this would be unlikely, but it would be what one expected from SNPs whose effects were very imprecisely estimated by a too-small sample. Combined with the upper bound on maximum effect sizes set by the GWASes up to then, this strongly implied that the highly polygenic theory was correct. Examples of complex traits where increasingly large-scale GWASes have yielded the initial hits and then increasing numbers of hits as sample sizes increased from n&lt;20k to n&gt;100k or n&gt;300k include height, educational attainment, and schizophrenia.\n\nMissing heritability is found in GWAS with big enough sample sizes (Kuchenbaecker 2022). Yengo et al. (2022) finds all relavent snips using 21% of the genome (non-hidden heritability SNPs). Compared with previous attemps:\n\nLango Allen et al. (2010) with n=183,727 find 180 SNPs totaling to 10 percent SNP heritability\nWood et al. (2014) with n=253,288 find 697 SNPs totaling to 20 percent SNP heritability\nYengo et al. (2022) with n=5,380,080 find 12,111 SNPs totaling to 45 percent SNP heritability\n\nwe have been able to find much of the heritability what has been supposedly missing from twin studies. In general, twin studies show that height is roughly 60-70 percent heritable meaning that if we were to expand the amount of genome we were searching on, we could potentially catch up to the estimated percent.\nGWAS on educational attainment shows this trend as well:\n\n\n\nOkbay et al. (2022)\n\n\nAs stated in Okbay et al. (2022), GWAS can currently predict roughly 12 percent of variation in educational attainment. Twin studies show that the heritability of educational attainment is roughly 50-60 percent, so as the sample size increases, perhaps this “missing heritability problem” will be resolved as well.\n\n\n\n\nBrant, Angela M, Brett C Haberstick, Robin P Corley, Sally J Wadsworth, John C DeFries, and John K Hewitt. 2009. “The Developmental Etiology of High IQ.” Behavior Genetics 39: 393–405.\n\n\nBrant, Angela M, Yuko Munakata, Dorret I Boomsma, John C DeFries, Claire MA Haworth, Matthew C Keller, Nicholas G Martin, et al. 2013. “The Nature and Nurture of High IQ: An Extended Sensitive Period for Intellectual Development.” Psychological Science 24 (8): 1487–95.\n\n\nBriley, Daniel, and Elliot Tucker-Drob. 2013. “Explaining the Increasing Heritability of Cognitive Ability Across Development a Meta-Analysis of Longitudinal Twin and Adoption Studies.” Psychological Science 24 (July). https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797613478618.\n\n\nCalvin, Catherine M, Ian J Deary, Dinand Webbink, Pauline Smith, Cres Fernandes, Sang Hong Lee, Michelle Luciano, and Peter M Visscher. 2012. “Multivariate Genetic Analyses of Cognition and Academic Achievement from Two Population Samples of 174,000 and 166,000 School Children.” Behavior Genetics 42: 699–710.\n\n\nCattell, Raymond B. 1960. “The Multiple Abstract Variance Analysis Equations and Solutions: For Nature-Nurture Research on Continuous Variables.” Psychological Review 67 (6): 353.\n\n\n———. 1963. “THE INTERACTION OF HEREDITARY AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES 1.” British Journal of Statistical Psychology 16 (2): 191–210.\n\n\n———. 1965. “Methodological and Conceptual Advances in Evaluating Hereditary and Environmental Influences and Their Interaction.” In Methods and Goals in Human Behavior Genetics, 95–139.

    "text": "3.2 BUT twin studies erroneously assume that monozygotic twins are genetically identical\nFor this to actually violate assumptions underlying twin studies, the genetic difference must actually be a causal agent in changing phenotype similarity. There are 3.2 billion nucleotides in the human genome (Brown 2002) and 4,000 detectable SNPs across 3 million people related to educational attainment (Okbay et al. 2022) This means that if we assume that mutations happen randomly across all nucleotides, there is a phenomenally low possibility that a mutation occurs in the specific set of tagged SNPs that are influencing the relevant phenotype. Additionally, even if it does influence one of the SNPs that influence the relevant phenotype, this does not automatically indicate that the variability will change since the majority of mutations are neutral in their effects. (CK-12 2021) Even if the mutation is negative or positive, this will likely be undetected by twin studies since each SNP accounts for a very small percentage of the behavioral variability. (meaning probably relevant untagged SNPs make up an even smaller chunk of variability) (Chabris et al. 2015) And finally, even if there was some detectable influence of phenotype that disrupted concordance, this would actually bias heritability estimates down, rather than up."

What matters, and matters only, is whether this increased environmental similarity of MZ twins also causes the twins to be increasingly similar phenotypically. If there is a way to show that the greater environmental similarity of MZ twins has no impact on the phenotype, then its presence would be no obstacle to obtaining the heritability estimates used by twin studies. The equal environment assumption only assumes that monozygotic twins do not have phenotype-influencing trait-relevant environments that are more similar than those of an average pair of dizygotic siblings.\nWhether environmental influence is the causal factor for higher concordance of phenotype among monozygotic twins is purely an empirical question since the default, parsimonious model for twin studies shows that higher concordance among monozygotic twins is solely due to additive genetic variation.

    "text": "3.4 BUT twin studies erroneously assume that monozygotic twins are not treated more similarly than dizygotic twins\nThe equal environments assumption has been tested several times- virtually all of them finding no violation of the assumption. Supplementary materials from Barnes et al. (2014) reviews the literature of the equal environments assumption and supports it. Felson (2014) comprehensively reviewed the evidence on the equal environments assumption, and did its own analysis with the most comprehensive set of controls to date. Correcting for violations adjusted heritability figures downwards only very modestly; heritability figures, at most, go down by about 10%. It is important to consider that this line of research is often merely correlational: Correcting twin class correlations for “environmental” similarity should be done with caution because such corrections may be inadvertently committing the sociologist’s fallacy. The entire goal is to root out causality. Genetic similarity may cause “environmental” similarity rather than the other way around.\nTo rigorously test the classical twin method for genetic causality, we must ask why identical twins would have more similar environments than fraternal twins if not for reasons of genotype creating environment. This leaves us with essentially three options:\n\n(Hypothesis 1) In terms of physical appearance, identical twins look more similar to each other than do fraternal twins, the phenotypic similarity is caused by people discriminating based on appearance.\n(Hypothesis 2) The linguistic label of “identical twins” causes people to apply more similar treatment to such twin pairs than they do to fraternal twin pairs.\n(Hypothesis 3) Identical twins have more similar prenatal environments than fraternal twins have, and this causes greater trait similarity."

    "text": "3.5 BUT since identical twins look more similar to each other than do fraternal twins, the phenotypic similarity is caused by people discriminating based on appearance. (Hypothesis 1)\nIf the physical similarity of monozygotic twins causes the environmental similarity that renders phenotypic similarity- this means that if genetics are controlled for, (and physical similarity is not) there will be no change to the phenotypic similarity. To directly test this, we can test to see which element is causal by controlling for genetic similarity using misidentified twins. Dizygotic twins who look sufficiently similar to be misclassified as monozygotic twins will preserve physical similarity- despite having only 50 percent of genetic similarity. If misidentified dizygotic twins have the same concordance for phenotype as dizygotic twins, the parsimonious explanation is that genetic difference is the causal effect in phenotypic similarity. (Scarr and Carter-Saltzman 1979; Scarr 1982; Kendler et al. 1993, 1994; Xian et al. 2000; Borkenau et al. 2002; Cronk et al. 2002; Gunderson et al. 2006; Conley et al. 2013)\nAnother interesting way to assess the causal nature of physical similarity is to see if unrelated doppelgangers have any trait similarity- which they don’t. (Segal 2013; Segal, Graham, and Ettinger 2013) To indirectly test this, we can look at several different types of studies that assess if phenotypic difference is environmentally incurred. For example, we know that being attractive will offer preferential treatment (Benson, Karabenick, and Lerner 1976; Talamas, Mavor, and Perrett 2016; Hamermesh, Gordon, and Crosnoe 2019) however attractiveness is uncorrelated, if not, slightly negatively correlated with intelligence (Feingold 1992; Mitchem et al. 2015). Another indirect measurement is to see if sex-effects overpower zygosity at all since we would reasonably assume environments treat males and females differently. There however is not much effect (Polderman et al. 2015; Stringer, Polderman, and Posthuma 2017)."

    "text": "3.7 BUT identical twins have more similar prenatal environments than fraternal twins have, and this causes greater trait similarity. (Hypothesis 3)\nIdentical twins are not more similar than fraternal twins because of prenatal effects. About 1 in 4 pairs monozygotic twins do not share a single chorion and so have separate placentas. A large body of evidence shows that “monochorionic” monozygotic twins are no more similar to each other than “dichorionic” monozygotic twins are to each other. (Van Beijsterveldt et al. 2016). Marceau et al. (2016) is a review of the literature on the prenatal environment and concludes that if anything, “results do, however, consistently suggest that heritability estimates are underestimated for measures of birth weight and early growth when chorionicity is not taken into account.” This finding mirrors Scarr (1982) which said “If this antenatal environmental bias exists [differences in antenatal nourishment, especially in monochorial MZ twins], it reduces rather than raises genetic estimates by introducing environmental differences between genetically identical twins.”\nInterestingly, prenatal effects do not seem likely to be a source of any long term effects (Dulal et al. 2018) and maternal genotype may strongly influence prenatal environment anyway.

    "section": "4.1 BUT Galton ignored possible environmental factors for the children of eminent people to be eminent as well.",
    "text": "4.1 BUT Galton ignored possible environmental factors for the children of eminent people to be eminent as well.\nGalton specifically avoids this: in the beginning of Hereditary Genius he writes: “I must not compare the sons of eminent men with those of non-eminent, because much of which I should ascribe to breed, others might ascribe to parental encouragement and example” (Galton 1891, 37). It was precisely for this reason that he undertook to compare the proportion of eminent people among the biological children of eminent people with adopted sons of Popes and other dignitaries of the Roman Catholic Church, in the attempt to disentangle possibly confounding influences from heredity and environment. In his own words: “If social help is really of the highest importance, the nephews [adopted children] of the Popes will attain eminence as frequently, or nearly so, as the sons of other eminent men; otherwise, they will not” (Galton 1891, 42). And the data clearly indicated a significant difference between the two groups, leading Galton to conclude that the environmental explanation could not be the whole story. This does not prove that Galton was right, of course, but it does show that his argument was immensely more sophisticated than Moore pictured it.\nBUT Galton never pointed out that more than half his “geniuses” turned up in families with no history of distinction at all. Galton did point out that among poets, musicians, painters, divines, and scholars, more than half of the illustrious men came from families with no history of distinction (Galton 1891, 228, 239, 249, 274, 283, 300). This methodological criticism is both factually incorrect and entirely irrelevant. First, Furthermore, summing up the information for all the professions that he considered, Galton concluded from his tabulated data that, cumulatively, “exactly one-half of the illustrious men have one or more eminent relations” (Galton 1891, 322),from which it deductively follows that one-half of the illustrious men did not have any eminent relations. Second, it is unclear why Jones thinks that the fact of more than half of geniuses turning up in families with no distinction would create a problem for Galton’s hereditarianism. Since Galton’s illustrious men were selected in such a way that their ratio to the general population was 1 to 4,000, the hereditarian explanation could easily accommodate the proportion of eminent people from no-distinction families significantly higher than 50 percent."

    "text": "4.2 BUT Ronald A. Fisher once called heritability “one of those unfortunate shortcuts, which have often emerged in biometry for lack of a more thorough analysis of the data” (R. Fisher 1951, 217).\n\nFirst, Fisher’s paper addressed issues connected with animal breeding problems. Fisher’s argument seems to be an inappropriate instrument for their human behavioral genetics.1\nSecond, Fisher happily used heritability in his book, “The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection” where he talks about “the fraction of the total observable variance of the measurement, which may be regarded as genetic variance” (Ronald A. Fisher 1930, 33). He left that part unchanged in the significantly revised second edition of 1958. Many times, he additionally talked about heritable variation (Ronald Aylmer Fisher, Bennett, et al. 1983, 140), about the genetic component of variance vs. total phenotypic variance (Ronald Aylmer Fisher, Bennett, et al. 1983, 228). Elsewhere, again, Fisher praised Galton for trying to give numerical precision to concepts like “the strength of inheritance”, or heritability. (Ronald Aylmer Fisher 1959, 2)\nThird, Fisher’s disparaging comment about heritability was far from being universally accepted. His worry was mainly about the heritability value being under undue influences of measurement error and changes in population parameters. For instance, his view was criticized by Johansson for “missing the important point that for practical breeding work we need estimates of heritability that are valid under the conditions where they will be applied” (Johansson et al. 1961, 9).\nFourth, Fisher’s grounds for dissatisfaction with heritability were completely different from the reasons of the critics who quote him in support of their own views. In the opinion of most of the authors who cite Fisher, one of the main problems with heritability is that genetic variance (the numerator) cannot be determined because of the confounding influence of gene–environment interaction. But Fisher himself had nothing but contempt for this kind of criticism, as seen from his letter to the son of Charles Darwin in 1935: “There is one point in which Hogben and his associates are riding for a fall, and that is in making a great song about the possible, but unproved, importance of non-linear interactions between hereditary and environmental factors. J. B. S. Haldane seems tempted to join in this” (Ronald Aylmer Fisher, Bennett, et al. 1983, 260). It is rather funny that contemporary critics of heritability (some of them doing research in history of biology!) press the interaction objection, which Lewontin basically took over from (Hogben 1933), and then even present Fisher as their ally in this. By the way, Fisher’s judgment that Haldane “seems tempted to join in this” proved correct. Haldane’s book in which he defended Hogben’s position on interactions soon followed (Haldane 2016).\nFifth, while there is nothing wrong with these authors trying to support their opposition to human behavior genetics by relying on Fisher as a supreme authority in genetics (after all, he was one of the architects of the Modern Synthesis), they should be aware that they might not find his other views about genetics so appealing. Some of them would probably be shocked to know that, despite his derogatory aside about heritability, Fisher actually believed that genetics supports the heritability of racial differences in intelligence. At about the same time that he wrote the article they quote, he suggested the following formulation for the UNESCO statement on race: “Available scientific knowledge provides a firm basis for believing that the groups of mankind differ in their innate capacity for intellectual and emotional development, seeing that such groups differ undoubtedly in a very large number of their genes” (quoted in Provine 1986, 875 – italics added). This shows that one should be careful in choosing one’s authorities because they can force one to go in an unwanted direction."

    "text": "4.3 BUT Morton mismeasured skulls\nGould uses his expertise in biology to claim that Morton had bias and mismeasured a set of skulls to conclude craniometric differences between ancestral populations. The set of 201 skulls from the Morton collection were re-examined in 1986 by John S. Michael in which the results were presented in a paper published in Current Anthropology. (Michael 1988) Michael found that the differences reported by Morton were basically corroborated by his remeasurements. Michaels strongly outlines his scientific and philosophical differences with Morton but concludes that he could find no indication of the systematic bias that Gould ascribed to Morton, and that in his opinion, “Morton’s research was conducted with integrity” (Michael 1988, 353).\nMorton’s discovery is accepted today in standard reference books (see Sternberg 1982, 773; BRODY 1992, 301; Nicholas Mackintosh 2011, 184), and even by mainstream environmentarians like Ulric Neisser. As a responsible psychologist who knows that this kind of dispute is ultimately resolved by empirical verification, he had no other choice but to concede that with respect to the racial differences in the mean measured sizes of skulls and brains, “there is indeed a small overall trend in the direction [Lynn and Rushton] describe” (Neisser 1997, 80)2"

The testers’ growing influence produced the eventual inclusion of an IQ test and a new rationale for 11+, but not the examination itself or its social functions.

Selection was already built into the system: the only question at issue was the basis on which it was to occur.”\nIQ tests were thus not used to establish a system of selective secondary education.
